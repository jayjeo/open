The cognitive aspects include perceiving and interpreting the environmental data, reasoning about their potential impact on equipment performance, and making decisions about necessary adjustments. These mental processes align with the definition of a cognitive task.

However, the task also involves manual components, such as physically checking and reading instruments that measure humidity and temperature, as well as making hands-on adjustments to the equipment or environmental control systems. These actions require sensory-motor coordination and physical manipulation, which are characteristics of a manual task.
