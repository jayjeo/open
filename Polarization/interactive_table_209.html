However, the task also has a minor manual component as the evaluator may need to physically manipulate the robot or its controls during the evaluation process. Therefore, while the task is largely cognitive, the manual aspect cannot be completely ignored, hence the score of 0.7.", "reasoning_cognitive_OPUS": "Explanation: Evaluating robotic systems or prototypes is primarily a cognitive task, as it involves analyzing, assessing, and making judgments about the performance, functionality, and design of the robotic systems. This process requires mental skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making.\n\nHowever, there may be some manual elements involved in the evaluation process, such as physically interacting with the robotic system, operating it, or making adjustments to test its capabilities. These manual aspects are likely to be minor compared to the cognitive aspects of the task.\n\nGiven the strong emphasis on cognitive processes in evaluating robotic systems, but acknowledging the potential for some manual involvement,"}];
