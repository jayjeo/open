2. Standardized processes: Collection efforts often follow standardized procedures and protocols, which can be codified into automated systems or scripts. This further contributes to the routine nature of the task.

3. Human oversight and exceptions</td>
            
            <td>This task, while having some elements that could potentially be automated such as recording and updating information, also requires some level of human judgment and discretion. For instance, determining the status of collection efforts might require interpreting complex situations or handling exceptions that automated systems cannot adequately address. However, the majority of the task could potentially be automated with the use of appropriate software, hence the score leans towards being a routine task.

It involves a repetitive process that, in many cases, can be automated. For instance, in a warehouse setting, automated systems can pick and pack items based on an order list. However, there is a level of human oversight required, particularly in cases where the item is out of stock or if there's an error in the order. This requires human intervention to resolve the issue, making the task not fully automatable.

From a cognitive perspective, this task requires understanding the order, remembering or locating the items in the stock, and making decisions about how to best fulfill the order. These activities involve perception, memory, and decision-making, which are characteristics of cognitive tasks. However, this task also has a significant manual component. It involves physically retrieving items from the stock, which requires the use of hands and sensory-motor coordination. It may also involve manipulating tools or objects, such as a handheld scanner or a cart to transport items.
