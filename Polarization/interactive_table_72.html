Creating schedules and station arrangements requires considering various factors, such as employee availability, workload distribution, and operational requirements, which are cognitive in nature. Keeping attendance records also involves cognitive elements, such as attention to detail, memory, and information processing.

However, there may be some minor manual components involved, such as physically writing or typing the schedules and records, which prevents assigning a score of 1. The manual aspects are minimal compared to the dominant cognitive nature of the task.

On one hand, some parts of these tasks can be automated. For instance, software can be used to track expenditures and generate financial reports, which is a routine aspect. On the other hand, approving expenditures and preparing budgets require human judgment and decision-making based on the specific context and goals of the organization, which is a non-routine aspect. Therefore, while there are elements of this task that can be automated, the need for human discretion and decision-making in certain aspects makes this task moderately routine.</td>
