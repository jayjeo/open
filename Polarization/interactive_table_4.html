            <td>This task is primarily a cognitive task. Reading a prescription, measuring arterial blood gases, and reviewing patient information to assess a patient's condition involves a significant amount of cognitive processing. These activities require understanding, interpreting, analyzing, and decision-making skills, which are all cognitive processes. However, the act of measuring arterial blood gases has a manual component as it involves the physical process of drawing and handling the blood sample. Therefore, while this task is primarily cognitive, the presence of a manual component prevents it from being classified as an extremely cognitive task. Hence, the score of 0.8, which indicates a strong but not exclusive cognitive emphasis.</td>
            
            <td>Explanation: The task "Read prescription, measure arterial blood gases, and review patient information to assess patient condition" is primarily a cognitive task with some minor manual elements.

The cognitive aspects include:
1. Reading and comprehending the prescription, which requires language processing and understanding.
2. Reviewing patient information, which involves memory, attention, and information processing to gather relevant data.
3. Assessing the patient's condition based on the prescription, blood gas measurements, and patient information. This requires critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making skills to interpret the data and draw conclusions about the patient's health status.

The manual component is measuring arterial blood gases, which</td>
