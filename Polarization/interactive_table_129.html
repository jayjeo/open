Some aspects of the task, such as data collection and processing, can be automated to a certain extent using advanced technologies like X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, or cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These technologies allow for the generation of high-resolution structural data that can be analyzed using computational methods.\n\nHowever, the task also requires significant human input and expertise.

It involves the use of advanced scientific knowledge and problem-solving skills to interpret data from techniques such as X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. While there are computer programs that can aid in the process, they are tools that supplement human judgment rather than replace it. The task also involves a level of unpredictability, as the structure of a new macromolecule cannot be known in advance. Therefore, it leans more towards being a non-routine task.
