The reviewer must use their knowledge and understanding of the publication's standards, style, and requirements to assess the quality and accuracy of the proofs. This process involves decision making, as the reviewer must determine whether the proofs meet the necessary criteria for approval. The task also requires memory and learning, as the reviewer must be familiar with the specific guidelines and expectations for the publication.
