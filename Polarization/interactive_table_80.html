The manual aspects include the physical act of writing or typing to create and update the records and logs. This requires some level of manual dexterity and hand-eye coordination.

However, the cognitive aspects are more significant in this task. Maintaining accurate records requires attention to detail, memory, and information processing. The parking enforcement officer must correctly categorize and log various activities, which involves perception, reasoning, and decision-making skills. Keeping records of contested citations also requires cognitive skills such as evaluating and organizing information.

However, the task also involves a significant non-routine component, as it requires human judgment to determine whether an offense has occurred and to decide on the appropriate response. This could involve unpredictable and complex situations that cannot be adequately addressed by automated systems or programs. Therefore, while the task has some routine elements, it also requires human discretion and judgment, making it moderately routine.</td>
