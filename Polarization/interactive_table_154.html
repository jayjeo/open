This task involves the collection and processing of data, which is a routine task that can be automated to some extent. For example, data collection, basic analysis, and even the generation of standard reports can be automated using current technology. However, the task also requires a degree of human input, particularly when it comes to interpreting the data, conducting root cause analyses, and identifying quality trends. These aspects involve unpredictable problem-solving and decision-making skills that are not easily replicated by automation technologies.
