The task involves evaluating complex, unpredictable factors that may not be fully captured by automated systems. It requires a nuanced understanding of the specific context, potential consequences, and the ability to make decisions in ambiguous or uncertain circumstances.</td>
            
            <td>This task of authorizing reinsurance of policy when risk is high is moderately non-routine. While some aspects of the task can be automated, such as calculating the risk based on predefined criteria, the final decision-making process often requires human intervention. This is because it involves complex and unpredictable problem-solving, which cannot be fully automated. The decision-maker needs to consider various factors, including the current market conditions, the company's risk tolerance, and the potential impact on the company's financial health. These factors can change rapidly and are often subject to interpretation, requiring human intuition and judgement. Therefore, while the task has some routine elements, it leans towards being non-routine due to the complexity and unpredictability involved in the decision-making process</td>
