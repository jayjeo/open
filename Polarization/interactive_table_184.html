The decision of when to order and how much to order can depend on a variety of factors, such as expected demand, budget constraints, and supplier reliability. These variables require human judgement and cannot be entirely predicted or automated. Therefore, while this task is largely routine, the need for human oversight and decision-making places it slightly towards the non-routine end of the scale</td>

            <td>Explanation: Monitoring medical supplies and placing orders when inventory is low involves a combination of cognitive and manual elements. The cognitive aspects include:

1. Perception and attention: Observing and keeping track of inventory levels.
2. Decision making: Determining when to place orders based on inventory thresholds.
3. Memory: Recalling inventory management procedures and supplier information.

The manual aspects, while less prominent, may include:

1. Physical handling of supplies: Checking stock levels and organizing inventory.
2. Use of tools: Interacting with inventory management software or systems.
