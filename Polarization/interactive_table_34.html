Planning the placement of caskets at funeral sites requires cognitive skills such as decision making, problem-solving, and possibly some level of spatial reasoning to determine the best layout. This is a process that would involve mental visualization and strategic planning, which are cognitive activities. On the other hand, the actual placement of caskets, adjustment of lights, fixtures, or floral displays are manual tasks. These involve the use of hands and sensory-motor coordination, physical effort, and possibly manipulation of tools or objects. While both aspects are integral to the task, the cognitive component seems slightly more prominent, hence the score leans a bit more towards the cognitive side.</td>
            
            <td>Explanation: The task of planning the placement of caskets at funeral sites or adjusting lights, fixtures, or floral displays involves a combination of cognitive and manual elements.

Cognitive aspects:
- Planning the placement of caskets requires spatial reasoning and decision-making skills to determine the most appropriate arrangement based on factors such as available space, aesthetics, and any specific requirements or preferences.
- Adjusting lights and fixtures involves understanding the desired ambiance and making decisions about the intensity, direction, and color of the lighting to create the appropriate atmosphere.
- Arranging floral displays requires creativity and an understanding of design principles to create visually appealing and meaningful arrangements.

Some aspects of the process, such as reviewing resumes, scheduling interviews, and conducting standardized training sessions, can be partially automated or follow predictable patterns. However, the core of the task requires human judgment, intuition, and adaptability.

During interviews, the interviewer must engage in unpredictable conversations, assess candidates' qualifications and fit for the role, and make decisions based on complex factors that are difficult to automate. The hiring decision itself requires weighing multiple variables and using human discretion to determine the best candidate for the position.
