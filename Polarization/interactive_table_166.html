The cognitive aspects include interpreting the ultrasonic data, analyzing patterns, and making decisions based on the information gathered. This requires mental processes such as perception, reasoning, and problem-solving skills to accurately identify and locate defects within the material.

However, the task also involves manual components, as the operator needs to physically handle the ultrasonic testing equipment, position it correctly on the material being tested, and manipulate the device to obtain accurate readings. This requires a certain level of dexterity, precision, and sensory-motor coordination.

            <td>The task of monitoring inventory levels and ordering supplies as necessary can be seen as a moderately routine task. Today, many inventory management systems are capable of automating these tasks. They can monitor inventory levels in real-time, send alerts when certain items are running low, and even automatically place orders based on pre-set parameters. However, there can still be elements of non-routine work involved. For instance, a human might need to decide when and how to adjust the pre-set parameters based on factors such as changes in demand, supplier reliability, or storage capacity. Also, unexpected situations may arise that require human intervention, such as dealing with supplier issues or handling discrepancies in inventory counts.

1. Tracking and mentally processing inventory data
2. Deciding when to place orders based on inventory levels
3. Determining the quantity of supplies to order

These cognitive elements involve perception, memory, decision making, and information processing.

However, there are also some manual components, such as:

1. Physically checking inventory stock
2. Handling and counting supplies
3. Placing orders, which may involve filling out forms or using a computer
