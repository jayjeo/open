            <td>Explanation: Inspecting machinery to determine necessary adjustments and repairs involves a combination of manual and cognitive elements. The task requires physical interaction with the machinery, which is a manual component. The inspector must use their hands, senses, and possibly tools to examine the equipment, requiring manual dexterity and sensory-motor coordination.

However, the cognitive aspects of this task are also significant. Determining the necessary adjustments and repairs requires mental processes such as perception, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. The inspector must analyze the machinery's condition, identify issues, and use their knowledge and experience to determine the appropriate course of action.

Industrial weighing systems and automated dispensers can accurately measure and combine ingredients based on preset formulas and quantities. These systems require minimal human oversight, mainly for setup, maintenance, and quality control.

However, there may be occasional instances where human intervention is necessary, such as troubleshooting equipment malfunctions, adjusting formulas for specific batches, or handling unusual ingredients. These situations prevent the task from being classified as extremely routine (0).
