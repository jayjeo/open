It involves mental processes like communication, information sharing, and strategic thinking. Exchanging ideas and knowledge requires cognitive skills such as language comprehension, memory, and reasoning. Developing and discussing strategies for sales or marketing relies heavily on mental processes like problem-solving, decision making, and pattern recognition.

While there might be some manual elements involved, such as using a computer or writing notes during the collaboration, these are secondary to the main cognitive aspects of the task. The core of the activity is the mental exchange and processing of information, not the physical actions.

The routine element is the process of gathering information from these sources, which could potentially be automated to some extent, especially in the case of credit bureaus that provide electronic access to credit reports. However, the interpretation of this information and making decisions based on it, such as assessing the credibility of personal references or making judgments about creditworthiness, requires human intuition and judgment. These non-routine elements make the task less amenable to full automation, hence the score of 0.6, slightly leaning towards the non-routine side.</td>
