The manual aspect involves physically observing and possibly handling the containers to gather the necessary information. This requires sensory-motor skills and physical interaction with the environment.

However, the task also has significant cognitive components. Specifying the amounts or types of equipment or waste disposed requires mental processing, categorization, and attention to detail. The worker must use their knowledge and understanding to accurately identify and classify the items being recorded.

The need for quantification and categorization adds a layer of cognitive demand to the task. The worker must maintain focus, ensure accuracy, and make judgments based on their observations and knowledge</td>

The main focus of the task is on the physical actions required to complete the job.

However, there may be a slight cognitive component in understanding the proper technique for using the tampers and determining the appropriate amount of dirt and packing required for optimal coverage and stability. This cognitive aspect is minimal compared to the predominantly manual nature of the task.
