Cognitive aspects:
- Perception and visual analysis are required to observe and compare the impression marks and the objects.
- Reasoning and decision-making skills are necessary to determine whether a specific object matches a specific mark.
- Memory may be involved in recalling characteristics of different objects and marks.

Manual aspects:
- Physical manipulation of the objects and impression marks may be necessary to examine them from different angles.
- Sensory-motor coordination is required to handle the objects and marks carefully.

This process relies heavily on human expertise, experience, and the ability to consider multiple factors, such as the client's unique needs, preferences, and response to treatment.

This task requires a high degree of human judgment, intuition, and the ability to handle unpredictable changes in a client's status. It involves assessing the client's progress, understanding the nuances of their condition, and making informed decisions about the best course of action. While certain elements of client monitoring could potentially be automated, the decision-making process and the ability to adapt treatment approaches to the unique needs of each client are complex tasks that currently cannot be fully automated.

Developing and implementing creative solutions: Effective programs often require innovative strategies to engage participants, communicate information, and promote", "reasoningGPT": "This task is largely non-routine. Planning or conducting programs to prevent substance abuse or improve community health or counseling services requires a great deal of human intuition, creativity, and unpredictable problem solving. These tasks involve understanding complex social issues, designing tailored interventions, and working directly with people in often unpredictable and emotionally charged situations. While some elements of these tasks could potentially be supported by automation, such as data collection or scheduling, the core of the work is fundamentally human and cannot be replicated by current automation technologies. Therefore, this task is classified as extremely non-routine.", "cognitivescore": 0.8999999761581421, "cognitivescoreGPT": 1.0, "cognitivescoreOPUS": 0.8, "reasoning_cognitive_GPT": "This task is a fully cognitive task. Planning or conducting programs to prevent substance abuse, improve community health, or provide counseling services requires a high degree of mental processes. These include perception, thinking, reasoning, decision making, learning, and other aspects of information processing. The task involves understanding the needs of a community, designing appropriate interventions or services, making decisions based on available resources, and evaluating the effectiveness of these programs. While there may be some elements of manual work involved, such as writing reports or using a computer to research and plan, the core of the task is cognitive. Therefore, it is classified as an extremely cognitive task.", "reasoning_cognitive_OPUS": "Explanation: Planning or conducting programs to prevent substance abuse or improve community health or counseling services is primarily a cognitive task. It involves a significant amount of mental processes, such as:\n\n1. Perception and analysis: Assessing the current state of substance abuse, community health, or counseling services in a given area.\n\n2. Problem-solving: Identifying the root causes of issues and developing strategies to address them effectively.\n\n3. Decision making: Choosing the most appropriate interventions, programs, or services based on the identified needs and available resources.\n\n4. Learning and knowledge application: Utilizing knowledge of public health, psychology, and social work to design and implement effective programs."}];
