This requires perception, decision making, and potentially problem-solving skills if the situation escalates. The manual component comes into play if the worker needs to physically remove the customer. This requires physical effort and sensory-motor coordination. However, as the task description does not make it clear how often physical removal is required, and because the decision to remove a customer is primarily a cognitive one, the task leans slightly more towards the cognitive side. Therefore, a score of 0.6 is assigned.</td>

The cognitive aspects include:
1. Assessing the situation and determining if a customer's behavior warrants intervention.
2. Communicating with the customer, asking them to leave the premises.
3. Making decisions about when and how to intervene.

The manual aspects include:
1. Physically approaching the customer.
2. Using physical force to remove the customer if they do not comply with the request to leave.

However, there is a cognitive component in following and interpreting the given instructions. The person must understand the directions, visualize the desired arrangement, and make decisions on how to execute the plan. This requires some level of perception, comprehension, and basic problem-solving skills.

            <td>Explanation: The task of delivering orders to kitchens, picking up food, and serving it when ready is primarily a manual task. It involves physical activities such as walking, carrying, and handling objects (orders, food). The sensory-motor coordination required to balance and transport items further emphasizes the manual nature of the task.

However, there is a minor cognitive component involved in remembering orders, matching food to the correct tables, and possibly some basic decision-making or problem-solving if issues arise during the process. These cognitive elements are not the main focus of the task, but they do contribute to its successful execution.

1. Assessing the needs of the patrons: This requires understanding and interpreting their preferences, group size, and any special requirements they may have.

2. Knowing the layout and characteristics of available tables: The person assigning tables must be familiar with the seating arrangements, table sizes, and locations within the establishment.

3. Matching patrons to appropriate tables: Based on the assessment of patrons' needs and the knowledge of available tables, the person must make a decision on the most suitable table assignment.

The manual aspects include physically handling the cash, checks, and deposit slips, as well as traveling to the bank to make the deposit. These activities require sensory-motor coordination and physical manipulation of objects.

However, the task also involves significant cognitive elements. Preparing cash receipts requires attention to detail, accuracy in counting and recording the money, and ensuring that the receipts match the actual cash on hand. This process involves mental processes such as perception, memory, and decision-making. Additionally, the employee must follow established procedures and guidelines, which requires understanding and applying information.

However, the task seems to lean slightly more towards cognitive as the decision-making and information processing aspects are crucial for successful completion of the task. Therefore, a score of 0.6 is appropriate.</td>
            
            <td>Explanation: Arranging shipments of baggage, express mail, and parcels involves a blend of manual and cognitive tasks. The manual aspects include physically handling the items, such as lifting, moving, and placing them on scales for weighing. This requires some level of physical effort and dexterity.

However, the task also involves significant cognitive elements. Providing billing services necessitates mental processes like calculation, data entry, and attention to detail. It requires an understanding of pricing structures, weight categories, and potentially using software or systems to generate invoices or labels. The worker must also communicate with customers, answer questions, and ensure accurate information processing.
