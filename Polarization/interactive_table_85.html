            <td>Explanation: Assembling aircraft cameras, photographic equipment, or frames is primarily a manual task. It involves the physical manipulation of objects, tools, and equipment, requiring manual dexterity, precision, and sensory-motor coordination. The use of diagrams, blueprints, bench machines, hand tools, or power tools further emphasizes the manual nature of the task.

However, there is a slight cognitive component involved in interpreting the diagrams and blueprints, which requires some level of perception, understanding, and mental processing. This cognitive aspect prevents the task from being classified as a fully manual task with a score of 0.
