            <td>Explanation: Regulating heating, lighting, and ventilation systems involves a combination of manual and cognitive elements. The manual aspects include physically adjusting controls, switches, or settings on the systems to change temperature, illumination, or airflow. This requires some level of physical interaction and dexterity.

However, the cognitive aspects are more prominent. Determining the appropriate settings for passenger comfort requires assessing and processing information about the current conditions, considering factors such as outside temperature, time of day, number of passengers, and feedback from individuals. It involves decision-making to strike a balance that will satisfy the majority of passengers.

Monitoring the systems over time also requires attention, perception of changes</td>
