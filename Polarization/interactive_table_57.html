For instance, the individual performing the ceremony often needs to adapt to the specific circumstances of the wedding, such as personalizing the ceremony to the couple's wishes, managing unpredictable events (like weather changes or emotional reactions), and interacting with a variety of people in a sensitive and meaningful way. These aspects of the task are not easily automated and require human judgment and discretion. Therefore, while</td>

However, there is also a manual component, as the officiant may need to handle objects such as rings or ceremonial items, guide participants to their places, and perform symbolic gestures or actions. The balance of these elements leans towards the cognitive side, but the presence of manual elements prevents this from being a purely cognitive task.

Cognitive aspects:
- Officiating a wedding ceremony requires mental processes such as speaking, reciting vows, and following a script or ritual.
- The officiant must be attentive to the couple and the proceedings, ensuring the ceremony flows smoothly.
- Decision-making skills are involved in handling any unexpected situations that may arise during the ceremony.

Manual aspects:
- The officiant may need to use their hands to hold a book, script, or microphone during the ceremony.

For example, a teacher may need to interpret attendance patterns or grade trends, and make decisions based on these observations.
