It requires dexterity, precision, and sensory-motor coordination to use hand and power cutting tools effectively. The task involves direct physical interaction with the tiles and tools, which is a key characteristic of manual tasks.

However, there is a minor cognitive component to this task. The tile cutter must perceive and analyze the space where the tile will be placed, considering the obstacles and odd spaces. They must then plan and decide how to cut and shape the tile to fit properly. This involves some level of spatial reasoning and problem-solving, which are cognitive skills.

Resolving employee grievances, in particular, demands a high level of human intuition and emotional intelligence to navigate complex interpersonal dynamics and find mutually agreeable solutions. This aspect of the task is highly non-routine and cannot be easily replicated by automation.</td>

However, it is not completely routine because the task of retouching and making color corrections may require some degree of human judgment and discretion, particularly in determining the appropriate color specifications. Thus, while the task is primarily routine, there is a slight non-routine element to it, which is why it is scored a bit closer to the routine end of the spectrum.", "cognitivescore": 0.6000000238418579, "cognitivescoreGPT": 0.6, "cognitivescoreOPUS": 0.6, "reasoning_cognitive_GPT": "This task involves both cognitive and manual elements, but it leans slightly more towards the cognitive side. The manual aspect of this task is represented by the physical act of entering data into a system. This could involve typing or using a mouse or other input device, which requires motor skills and hand-eye coordination. However, the cognitive aspects of this task seem to be more dominant. The task requires understanding of what the data represents (coordinates of images and color specifications), making decisions on how to retouch and make color corrections based on this data, and potentially interpreting and analyzing the results of these adjustments. This would involve perception, thinking, reasoning, decision-making, and other aspects of information processing.
