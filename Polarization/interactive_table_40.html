While some human input may be required for quality control, troubleshooting, or handling rare exceptions, the vast majority of the task is predictable and can be performed by machines.

            <td>This task leans more towards being non-routine. While certain aspects of it could potentially be automated, such as setting up a camera or capturing footage, the task as a whole requires human intuition and creativity. For example, a human would need to decide what to focus on during the news event, how to frame the shot, and when to start and stop recording. Furthermore, the task of requesting a photographer to provide coverage implies a level of unpredictability and decision-making that cannot be automated. Therefore, while there are routine elements, the task is predominantly non-routine.</td>

            <td>Explanation: Scheduling programming or reading television programming logs to determine which programs are to be recorded or aired is a highly routine task. It involves predictable activities that can be largely automated using computerized systems and algorithms.

The task primarily consists of processing structured information (programming logs) and making straightforward decisions based on predefined criteria, such as program schedules and recording preferences. Modern digital video recording (DVR) systems and content management software can handle most of these tasks automatically, with minimal human intervention.

However, there may be occasional instances where human judgment is required to resolve scheduling conflicts, handle last-minute changes, or make editorial decisions. These situations prevent the task from being classified as extremely routine</td>
            
            <td>The task of scheduling programming or reading television programming logs to determine which programs are to be recorded or aired is moderately routine. This is because it involves a certain level of predictable information processing, which can potentially be automated. For instance, a software program could be designed to read and interpret programming logs, and then make decisions about which programs to record or air based on predefined criteria. However, there is also some degree of human discretion involved in this task. For example, a human operator might need to make judgment calls about how to handle exceptions or unpredictable situations, such as last-minute changes to the programming schedule or technical issues with the recording equipment.

The cognitive aspect is present in the testing and maintaining of the equipment, which requires understanding how the equipment works, identifying potential issues, and making decisions about necessary maintenance or repairs. However, these cognitive aspects are applied in a practical, hands-on context, which introduces significant manual elements. The cleaning of the equipment is a manual task, requiring physical effort and potentially the manipulation of cleaning tools. The maintenance part could also involve the use of tools and physical manipulation of the equipment. Therefore, while there is a cognitive component, the task seems to be more manual in nature, hence the score slightly closer to the manual end of the spectrum", "reasoning_cognitive_OPUS": "Explanation: The task of testing, cleaning, and maintaining equipment involves a blend of manual and cognitive elements, but leans more towards the manual side.\n\nManual aspects:\n1. Cleaning equipment requires physical effort and manual dexterity.\n2. Maintaining equipment often involves hands-on work, such as replacing parts, lubricating components, or making physical adjustments.\n\nCognitive aspects:\n1. Testing equipment requires understanding how the equipment functions and interpreting results, which involves cognitive processes like reasoning and problem-solving.\n2.

Some aspects of this task, such as changing basic settings like focus or exposure based on predefined guidelines, can be considered relatively routine and potentially automatable.

This need for human input and decision-making in certain aspects of the task pushes it slightly towards the non-routine end of the spectrum.\n\nCurrent automation technologies can handle some of the more predictable and repetitive aspects of adjusting equipment settings.
