However, there may be instances where human judgment is required to handle exceptions or discrepancies in the records. For example, if a student disputes a grade or attendance mark, a human may need to investigate and resolve the issue.

These activities are largely predictable and can be automated to a significant extent using database systems and software tools.\n\nHowever, there may be some instances where human discretion is required, such as when dealing with exceptional cases or discrepancies in the records. For example, if a student disputes a grade or attendance record, a human may need to investigate and resolve the issue.
