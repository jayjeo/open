The physical actions of pulling and guiding are repetitive and predictable, which suggests the potential for automation. However, the use of hoisting equipment and the need to adapt to varying conditions on the vessel introduce some non-routine aspects.

The task does not require significant creativity or complex problem-solving skills that are uniquely human. While the unpredictability of weather conditions and the movement of the vessel may require some level of human judgment and adaptation, these challenges could potentially be addressed through advanced automation technologies.</td>

On one hand, the task of signaling itself could be considered somewhat routine, as it likely follows a set of standardized hand signals or communication protocols that workers are trained to use consistently. This aspect of the task leans towards the routine end of the spectrum.

However, the actual process of moving, hoisting, and positioning loads introduces more variability and unpredictability. The worker signaling must assess the specific load, its size, weight, and destination, and communicate appropriate instructions to guide the safe and accurate movement of the load. This requires a level</td>

However, it still requires a certain level of human oversight and judgement to assess the situation and determine the appropriate signals to give, especially in unique or unpredictable situations. This human judgement, while not as complex or creative as tasks on the non-routine extreme, still places this task slightly towards the non-routine end of the spectrum.

However, the decision-making process likely requires human judgment and intuition to interpret the maps and consider various factors such as terrain, animal behavior patterns, and environmental conditions.

While advanced mapping technologies and data analysis could assist in identifying optimal trap locations, the final decision would still depend on the trapper's experience, knowledge of the area, and ability to adapt to unique circumstances.

However, there is a slight cognitive component involved in this task. The worker needs to assess the tree's structure, determine the appropriate cuts to make, and plan the sequence of actions to ensure the desired outcome while maintaining safety. This requires a basic level of decision-making and problem-solving skills.

The physical actions of pulling and guiding are repetitive and predictable, which suggests the potential for automation. However, the use of hoisting equipment and the need to adapt to varying conditions on the vessel introduce some non-routine aspects.\n\nThe task does not require significant creativity or complex problem-solving skills that are uniquely human. While the unpredictability of weather conditions and the movement of the vessel may require some level of human judgment and adaptation, these challenges could potentially be addressed through advanced automation technologies.", "reasoningGPT": "This task, which involves pulling and guiding nets, traps, and lines onto vessels, by hand or using hoisting equipment, is moderately routine. It involves a level of predictability and repetition, as the same basic actions of pulling and guiding are performed consistently. However, it also requires a degree of human judgment and physical dexterity that may not be fully replicable by current automation technologies. For example, the human worker must be able to respond to changing conditions, such as the weight and movement of the nets, traps, or lines, as well as the conditions on the vessel and in the surrounding environment.
