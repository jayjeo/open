Modern laboratory equipment, such as automated cryostats or controlled-rate freezers, can precisely control the freezing process to ensure optimal tissue preservation. These instruments can be programmed to follow specific freezing protocols, reducing the need for human oversight and decision-making.

The manual aspect involves the physical manipulation of equipment to create the exposures, which requires sensory-motor coordination and dexterity. However, the task also has a significant cognitive component, as it requires the ability to assess the quality of the work against established standards and make decisions about whether to reject and repeat the work. This quality control aspect relies on perception, judgment, and decision-making skills, which are cognitive processes.
