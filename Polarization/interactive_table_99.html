Although it might seem like a routine task because it involves repetitive physical labor, it does require a certain level of human judgment and skill. For instance, the worker must decide where to chip or scrape, how much force to apply, and when the surface is smooth enough. These decisions are based on the worker's experience and understanding of the material and the desired outcome, which is difficult to automate completely. However, some aspects of this task could potentially be automated in the future, such as using robots to perform the physical labor, guided by sensors to detect high spots or rough projections.</td>

They must then use this information to perform calculations and make judgments to arrive at an accurate cost estimate.

While there may be some manual elements involved, such as inputting data into a spreadsheet or writing down figures, these are minor compared to the cognitive aspects of the task. The core of the task lies in the mental processes of analyzing information, performing calculations, and making informed estimates.

The task also necessitates the use of tools (likely wrenches or other fastening tools) to secure the bolts.

However, there is a minor cognitive component to this task. The worker must understand the proper placement and orientation of the crown blocks on the posts and follow a specific sequence or pattern for bolting them securely. This requires a basic level of understanding and mental processing.
