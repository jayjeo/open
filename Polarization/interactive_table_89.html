This is because the process likely follows a set of predefined rules and guidelines, making it predictable and potentially automatable to a certain extent.

However, there may be instances where human judgment is required to interpret and apply the policies correctly, especially if there are exceptions or unique situations that fall outside the standard procedures. This introduces a slight element of non-routine decision-making.

The manual components involve the physical actions of recording the observations, which may include writing, sketching, or using technological tools.

The task leans slightly more towards the cognitive side due to the critical role of mental processes in making detailed observations, analyzing the scene, and determining what information is relevant to record. However, the manual recording aspect is still a significant part of the task.

            <td>Explanation: The task of locating and documenting information regarding the next of kin is primarily a cognitive task. It involves mental processes such as information gathering, research, and documentation. The task requires the ability to search for and identify relevant information, understand relationships between individuals, and keep accurate records of notification attempts. These activities heavily rely on cognitive skills like attention to detail, memory, and information processing.

While there may be some minor manual elements involved, such as physically writing or typing the documentation, the core of the task is centered around the mental processes of locating and organizing information.
