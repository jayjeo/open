Conducting fire drills and inspecting fire suppression systems and portable fire systems are tasks that can be scheduled and performed regularly, which gives them a routine aspect. However, these tasks are not fully automatable with current technology. While some elements of the inspections can be automated, such as using sensors to monitor the status of fire suppression systems, human judgment is still needed to interpret the results, identify potential issues, and determine the appropriate actions to take.

The collaborative nature of the task also involves interpersonal communication and teamwork, which are non-routine elements.\n\nWhile technology can assist in certain aspects of menu planning, such as generating suggestions based on ingredient availability or customer data, the final decision-making an", "reasoningGPT": "This task requires a good deal of human input and creativity, making it lean towards the non-routine side of the spectrum. While certain aspects of the task could potentially be automated, such as gathering data on seasonal availability of ingredients or predicting the number of customers based on historical data, the core of the task involves collaboration, planning, and creative development of recipes or menus.

The primary activities involved - collaboration, planning, and development of recipes or menus - are cognitive tasks that require perception, thinking, reasoning, and decision making. These activities involve processing information about seasonal availability of ingredients and expected number of customers, and using this information to make decisions. However, there may be some manual aspects involved as well, such as possibly needing to handle or test ingredients or cooking methods while developing the recipes.

It involves several mental processes and skills, such as:\n\n1. Communication and collaboration: Working with other personnel requires effective verbal and written communication, as well as the ability to coordinate efforts and share ideas.\n\n2. Analytical thinking: Considering factors like seasonal availability of ingredients and the likely number of customers necessitates analyzing information and making informed decisions based on that analysis.\n\n3.

On the routine side, certain aspects of this task can be automated or systematized, such as calculating costs based on fixed inputs like food, labor, and overhead costs.

The analysis of recipes to assign prices is not purely formulaic; it requires human judgment and discretion.
