1. Planning and scheduling: Coordinating with supervisors to set up observation times requires organizational and time management skills.

2. Communication: Meeting with supervisors to discuss feedback involves verbal communication, active listening, and comprehension of the information provided.

3. Self-reflection and learning: Receiving feedback about teaching performance requires the ability to process and internalize the information, reflect on one's own performance, and learn from the feedback to improve future teaching practices.

However, the specific nature of the information requested by individual farmers may vary significantly and require a level of understanding, interpretation, and customization that goes beyond simple information retrieval.

Depending on the complexity and specificity of the farmers' requests, the task may demand a degree of human intuition and judgment to effectively address their unique needs. Researchers may need to analyze and synthesize information from multiple sources, apply domain knowledge</td>
            
            <td>This task involves researching information requested by farmers, which is moderately non-routine. Although some aspects of research can be automated, such as data collection or using search engines, the interpretation and application of the information is often unpredictable and requires human discretion. For instance, the type of information a farmer might request could vary greatly and could involve complex problem-solving or a deep understanding of specific agricultural issues. Therefore, while there are routine elements in the data collection process, the interpretation and application of the information leans towards being non-routine. Hence, a score of 0.6 is assigned, indicating a slight inclination towards non-routine characteristics.</td>

It involves several mental processes, including understanding the farmer's request, determining what information is needed, searching for and retrieving relevant information from various sources, analyzing and synthesizing the information, and presenting it in a way that addresses the farmer's needs. This task requires skills such as information literacy, critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication.

While the task may involve some manual elements, such as typing or navigating through resources, these are minor compared to the cognitive aspects. The core of the task lies in the mental processes of gathering, processing, and delivering information.
