For example, many modern hotels use electronic key card systems that automatically track when guests check out and vacate their rooms. This information can be seamlessly communicated to the housekeeping management system, which then assigns cleaning tasks to staff members based on predefined schedules and room priorities.

While there may be occasional exceptions or special requests that require minor human intervention, such as a guest requesting a late checkout or a room needing maintenance before cleaning, these situations can often be handled through standardized protocols.

For instance, a guest may have checked out but left belongings behind, which would require human intervention. Therefore, while this task is predominantly routine, it does have some non-routine elements, leading to a score of 0.3.</td>
