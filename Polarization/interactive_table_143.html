It involves mental processes such as communication, problem-solving, decision-making, and reasoning. Operators need to analyze the problems, share information, discuss potential solutions, and reach a consensus on the best course of action. These activities heavily rely on cognitive skills and abilities.

However, there might be a slight manual component depending on the nature of the problems and the solutions. For example, if the problems involve equipment malfunctions, the collaboration may lead to physically implementing a solution, which would require some manual work.

This task requires a high level of craftsmanship, skill, and creativity to ensure that the furniture is not only structurally sound but also aesthetically pleasing.
