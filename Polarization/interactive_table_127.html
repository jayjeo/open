These systems can identify common defects and compare products to predefined specifications, which is a relatively routine task.

However, the task also requires human judgment and decision-making to assess more complex or subtle defects that automated systems may not detect. Additionally, adjusting machinery to correct production problems involves problem-solving skills and may require creative solutions for unique or unexpected issues.

Depending on the complexity of the product and the nature of potential quality issues, human judgment and decision-making may be required to assess borderline cases, identify subtle defects, or make subjective evaluations of quality. Inspectors may need to adapt to unique product</td>
            
            <td>The task of examining products to verify conformance to quality standards is moderately routine. It often involves routine procedures and can be partially automated using quality control machines or software. However, it also requires a level of human discretion to handle exceptions or unexpected situations. For example, a machine might be able to detect obvious defects, but a human might be needed to evaluate more subtle issues, such as a slightly off color or a small defect in the material. Therefore, while this task has a significant routine component, it is not entirely automatable and requires some human judgment. Hence, it is scored closer to 0.5, but with a mild inclination towards routine characteristics.</td>

Cognitive aspects:
- Perception and attention are required to visually inspect products and identify any deviations from the quality standards.
- Memory and learning are involved in understanding and applying the specific quality standards for each product.
- Decision-making skills are necessary to determine whether a product meets the required standards or not.

Manual aspects:
- Physical handling of the products is required to examine them from different angles and perspectives.
