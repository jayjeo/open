            <td>Explanation: The task of holding auditions for parts or negotiating contracts with actors determined suitable for specific roles, working in conjunction with producers, is an extremely non-routine task. This is because it involves a high degree of unpredictability, human discretion, intuition, and creativity. 

In an audition, the decision of who is suitable for a specific role requires a deep understanding of the character, the script, and the actor's ability to portray the role, which is a highly subjective and nuanced process. It involves interpreting the actor's performance, making judgments about their suitability, and predicting their ability to deliver in the actual production. 

Similarly, contract negotiation is a complex process that requires understanding the unique needs and demands of each actor</td>

Similarly, negotiating contracts with actors involves cognitive skills such as reasoning, decision making, and potentially problem-solving if there are disagreements or issues to resolve. It also requires understanding of contract terms and conditions, which involves language comprehension. While there may be some manual elements involved, such as handling paperwork or using a computer to draft contracts, these are secondary to the cognitive elements of the task. Therefore, while not exclusively cognitive, this task is heavily weighted towards cognitive processes.</td>

While certain aspects of promotional appearances, such as the speeches or presentations, could potentially be automated or scripted, the task as a whole requires a significant level of human input. The individual making the appearance needs to interact with the public, answer unpredictable questions, and adapt their behavior based on the situation or audience. This requires human intuition, creativity, and problem-solving skills, which are key characteristics of non-routine tasks.
