            <td>The task of prescribing preoperative and postoperative treatments and procedures, such as sedatives, diets, antibiotics, or preparation and treatment of the patient's operative area, is primarily a cognitive task. It requires extensive knowledge, decision-making ability, and the application of complex reasoning, all of which are cognitive processes. The task involves diagnosing the patient's condition, understanding the implications of various treatments and procedures, and making an informed decision about the best course of action. While it may involve some manual components, such as writing the prescription or operating medical software, the core of the task is cognitive in nature. Therefore, it is appropriate to classify this task as an extremely cognitive task.</td>
            
            <td>Explanation: Prescribing preoperative and postoperative treatments and procedures is primarily a cognitive task. It involves the mental processes of assessing the patient's condition, considering various factors such as the type of surgery, the patient's medical history, and potential risks, and then making informed decisions about the appropriate treatments and procedures. This requires medical knowledge, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.

The task involves analyzing information, evaluating options, and determining the best course of action based on the specific needs of the patient and the surgical procedure. The physician must consider factors such as the patient's age, weight, allergies, and any pre-existing medical conditions when prescribing sedatives</td>
