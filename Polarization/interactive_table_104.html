            <td>The task of inspecting and examining printed products for print clarity, color accuracy, conformance to specifications, and external defects is moderately non-routine. While it might be possible to automate part of this task, such as checking conformance to specifications, the other aspects require human discretion and judgment. For instance, assessing print clarity and color accuracy often necessitates a human eye to make the final judgment, as machines may not capture the nuances discernible to humans. Similarly, identifying external defects might require human intuition to distinguish between significant and minor defects. Therefore, although it has some routine elements, the task leans towards being non-routine due to the level of human input required.</td>

Cognitive aspects:
1. Perception and attention: The task requires careful visual inspection and attention to detail to identify print clarity, color accuracy, and external defects.
2. Comparison and judgment: The inspector must compare the printed products against specifications or standards, requiring cognitive processes to make judgments about conformance.
3. Decision-making: Based on the examination, the inspector must decide whether the printed products meet the required quality standards.

It involves physical manipulation of the machine's controls using hands and requires sensory-motor coordination, dexterity, and precision. The worker must apply physical effort to interact with the machine's interface.

However, there is a minor cognitive element involved in understanding how the controls affect the machine's operation and determining the appropriate actions to take based on the desired printing outcome.
