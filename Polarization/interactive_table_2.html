            <td>Explanation: The task of representing an architect on a construction site involves a blend of cognitive and manual elements, with a slight inclination towards cognitive aspects.

Cognitive elements:
1. Ensuring builder compliance with design specifications requires understanding and interpreting architectural plans, which involves cognitive skills such as spatial reasoning and problem-solving.
2. Advising on design corrections necessitates decision-making and critical thinking abilities to identify and resolve issues that may arise during construction.
3. Working under the architect's supervision implies the need for effective communication and comprehension of instructions, which are cognitive processes.
