While the act of attending meetings and serving on committees can be scheduled and is predictable to a certain extent, the content and outcomes of these meetings are often unpredictable and require human input, discretion, and problem-solving abilities. The discussions in these meetings often involve complex problem solving, decision making, and interpersonal communication, which are not automatable by current technology.
