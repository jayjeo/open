However, there might be instances where human judgment is needed to make decisions when faced with alternatives, out-of-stock items, or special requests.

The majority of the task, such as checking inventory, placing orders, and tracking shipments, can be handled by computerized systems with minimal human intervention. This suggests a strong inclination towards a routine task. Nevertheless, the occasional need for human input to resolve exceptions or</td>
            
            <td>This task is primarily routine because it involves predictable processes that can be largely automated. For example, computer systems can track inventory and automatically reorder supplies when they fall below a certain level. However, there is a small degree of non-routine work involved. The selection of materials, such as textbooks, might require human discretion to ensure the chosen materials meet specific criteria or standards. This could involve assessing the quality of the material, its relevance to the course, and its appropriateness for the intended audience. While this aspect of the task could potentially be supported by technology, it would likely still require some level of human oversight and judgement.

This could be based on factors such as the relevance of the textbook's content to the course or study, the credibility of the authors, user reviews, and price. The manual aspect is involved in the actual process of obtaining the textbooks, which could include activities like physically going to a bookstore or library, picking up the books, and carrying them to a checkout counter or borrowing station.

            <td>Explanation: The task of selecting and obtaining materials and supplies, such as textbooks, involves a combination of manual and cognitive elements. 

The manual aspects include the physical handling and manipulation of the materials, which requires some level of sensory-motor coordination and dexterity. This might involve reaching for, grasping, and carrying the textbooks or other supplies.

However, the task also has significant cognitive components. Selecting the appropriate materials and supplies necessitates decision-making skills, as one must determine which items are needed based on the context or requirements. This selection process involves mental processes such as reasoning, judgment, and potentially memory if recalling specific materials is necessary.

While the process of writing and submitting grant proposals may follow a predictable structure and format, the content of each proposal requires a significant level of human input, creativity, and adaptability to the specific research project and funding agency guidelines.\n\nThe non-routine aspects of this task include:\n1. Developing unique research ideas and methodologies that align with the funding agency's priorities\n2. Crafting compelling narratives and arguments to justify the significance and feasibility of the proposed research\n3. Tailoring the proposal to the specific requirements", "reasoningGPT": "Writing grant proposals to procure external research funding is a task that leans more towards being non-routine. This task requires a high level of human creativity, intuition, and complex problem-solving skills. It involves understanding the research topic in depth, articulating the objectives and potential impacts of the research, and persuasively presenting the proposal to potential funders. This process is highly unpredictable and varies greatly depending on the research topic and the funding organization's requirements.
