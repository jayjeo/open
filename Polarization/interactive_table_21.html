            <td>Explanation: Photographing crime or accident scenes involves a combination of manual and cognitive skills. The manual aspects include physically handling the camera, adjusting settings, and positioning oneself to capture the desired images. This requires dexterity, precision, and sensory-motor coordination.

However, the task also involves significant cognitive elements. The photographer must perceive and analyze the scene, deciding what to photograph and how to compose the shots for optimal evidence collection. They must use judgment to determine the most relevant elements to capture and problem-solve to work around any challenges posed by the scene. Memory and attention are also important for ensuring thorough documentation.
