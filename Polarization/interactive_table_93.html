Selecting set props such as furniture, pictures, lamps, and rugs involves both cognitive and manual aspects. The cognitive aspect includes decision-making and perception, as one needs to decide which props will best fit the set and perceive how they will look together. This may also involve problem-solving if certain props do not fit the set as expected. The manual aspect includes the physical manipulation of the props, such as moving furniture and hanging pictures or lamps. However, the manual aspect is slightly more dominant as the task involves more physical activities, hence the score of 0.6.</td>

The cognitive aspects include perception, decision-making, and reasoning to choose appropriate props that align with the desired aesthetic, theme, or historical accuracy of the set. This requires an understanding of design principles, visual harmony, and the ability to envision how the props will contribute to the overall look and feel of the set.

However, the task also involves manual components, such as physically handling and arranging the props, which requires some level of dexterity and spatial awareness. The manual aspects are not as prominent as the cognitive ones, as the main challenge lies in making informed decisions about which props to select.
