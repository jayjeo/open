            <td>Explanation: Attending professional meetings, educational conferences, and teacher training workshops is primarily a cognitive task. These activities involve acquiring new knowledge, learning, and processing information to maintain and improve professional competence. Participants engage in mental processes such as listening, comprehending, analyzing, and synthesizing the information presented. They may also participate in discussions, problem-solving sessions, and decision-making activities, which are all cognitive in nature.

While there might be some minor manual components involved, such as taking notes or navigating the event venue, these are not the primary focus of the task. The core purpose is to engage in learning and professional development, which heavily relies on cognitive skills and abilities.
