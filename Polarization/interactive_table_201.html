It does not involve any physical processes or activities, hence it doesn't fall into the manual task category. Therefore, a score of 1, indicating an extremely cognitive task, is appropriate.</td>
            
            <td>Explanation: Assessing project feasibility by analyzing technology, resource needs, or market demand is a highly cognitive task. It involves complex mental processes such as perception, thinking, reasoning, and decision making. The task requires gathering and processing information about the project's technological requirements, the resources needed to complete it, and the potential market demand for the project's outcomes. This information must then be analyzed and synthesized to make a judgment about the project's overall feasibility.

The task does not involve any significant manual or physical components. While some minor physical actions might be involved, such as typing or using a computer to research and analyze data, these are incidental to the core cognitive nature of the task.</td>

Additionally, while certain HR functions like testing and selection may follow established guidelines, there is often a need for human judgment and discretion in interpreting results and making decisions. Performance management also requires human input to provide meaningful feedback, coach employees, and handle unique situations that may arise.

While some aspects of this task may be predictable and follow established protocols, such as the physical process of moving the body and the transportation logistics, there are also non-routine components that require human discretion and adaptability.\n\nThe unpredictable nature of the place of death, the specific circumstances surrounding each case, and the potential emotional complexities involved in handling the deceased and interacting with grieving family members or witnesses introduce non-routine elements to this task. The person performing this job must be able to assess the unique situation, make judgment calls", "reasoningGPT": "The task of removing the deceased from the place of death and transporting them to a funeral home is predominantly routine, as it follows a standard procedure and is predictable. However, it cannot be fully automated due to the sensitive nature of the task and the need for human discretion, care, and empathy. These factors prevent it from being fully routine, as there is a degree of unpredictability in handling the emotional aspects of the task and potential exceptions that may arise, such as dealing with the deceased's family or unexpected circumstances at the place of death.
