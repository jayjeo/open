The task involves following a set of predefined instructions, which suggests a level of predictability and potential for automation. Computer-controlled equipment implies that the monitoring process is already partially automated, with the human role being primarily supervisory.

However, the task is not assigned a score of 0 (extremely routine) because there may be instances where human judgment is required to interpret the instructions or handle unexpected situations that the computer-controlled system cannot address adequately.
