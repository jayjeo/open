This task also requires attention to detail and the ability to recognize patterns in the data (such as a student consistently being absent on a particular day). While there is a manual component, the cognitive aspects of this task are more prominent, hence the score of 0.7.</td>
            
            <td>Explanation: Maintaining student attendance records, grades, and other required records is primarily a cognitive task. It involves mental processes such as perception, attention to detail, memory, and information processing. The task requires the ability to accurately record and organize data, which relies on cognitive skills.

However, there is a minor manual component to this task, as it may involve physical activities such as writing or typing the records into a system or file. This manual aspect is relatively small compared to the cognitive elements of the task.

Given the strong emphasis on cognitive processes and the relatively minor manual component, I assign a score of 0.7, indicating that the task is predominantly cognitive but has a small manual element.</td>
