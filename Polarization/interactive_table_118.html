It involves the use of hand tools, chain falls, jacks, cranes, or hoists, which requires physical effort, dexterity, and sensory-motor coordination. The task description emphasizes the manipulation of tools and objects, which is a key characteristic of manual tasks.

However, there is a slight cognitive component to this task. The worker needs to understand how the machines are assembled and how to properly dismantle them without causing damage. This requires some level of knowledge, understanding, and decision-making skills. The worker must also follow proper safety procedures and troubleshoot any issues that</td>

Routine aspects:
- Logging production quantities and machine operating times can be largely automated using sensors and digital systems.

This task involves collecting data and entering it into a system, which are activities that can be automated to a large extent. For instance, many modern industrial machines are equipped with sensors and software that can automatically monitor and record production and maintenance data. However, the task isn't entirely routine because it may require some human intervention, especially in cases where the information is not straightforward or when exceptions occur.
