However, there may be some manual aspects involved, such as operating controls or inspecting physical aspects of the equipment, which prevents the task from being fully cognitive. Therefore, a score of 0.7 is appropriate as it acknowledges the primarily cognitive nature of the task while also accounting for potential manual elements.</td>
            
            <td>Explanation: Overseeing equipment start-up, characterization, qualification, or release involves a blend of cognitive and manual elements. The task requires cognitive skills such as understanding the equipment's functions, interpreting data, making decisions based on the equipment's performance, and ensuring that it meets the required standards for release. These aspects involve mental processes, reasoning, and problem-solving.

However, the task may also involve some manual components, such as physically interacting with the equipment, making adjustments, or performing hands-on tests. The degree of manual involvement may vary depending on the specific equipment and the nature of the start-up, characterization, qualification, or release process.

The cognitive aspect is evident in the need for understanding the principles behind the techniques, problem-solving to modify the techniques, and decision-making in the development of new techniques. This process would involve a high degree of knowledge, reasoning, and information processing, which aligns with the characteristics of a cognitive task. However, there is also a manual component to this task as it involves the physical manipulation of lab equipment and materials, requiring sensory-motor coordination and dexterity. Despite the manual component, the task leans more towards the cognitive side due to the high degree of understanding and mental processing", "reasoning_cognitive_OPUS": "Explanation: Developing or modifying wet chemical or industrial laboratory experimental techniques for nanoscale use is a task that primarily involves cognitive processes, but also includes some manual elements.\n\nThe cognitive aspects of this task are predominant. It requires applying scientific knowledge, understanding nanoscale principles, and using problem-solving skills to adapt existing techniques or create new ones suitable for nanoscale applications. This involves mental processes such as analysis, evaluation, and creative thinking to determine the appropriate modifications or innovations needed.\n\nHowever, there is also a manual component to this task. Implementing the developed or modified techniques in a laboratory setting will involve physical manipulation of equipment, materials, and tools at the nanoscale level"}];
