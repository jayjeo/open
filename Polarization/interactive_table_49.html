Manual aspects:
- The task requires physical interaction with the product samples, such as examining them visually, feeling their texture, and tasting them. These actions involve sensory-motor coordination and the use of hands and the body.

Cognitive aspects:
- Evaluating the quality, color, texture, flavor, and bouquet of the product samples requires mental processes such as perception, attention, and decision-making. The person performing the task must use their knowledge and experience to assess the characteristics of the samples and determine whether they meet the desired standards.

These tests involve measuring specific parameters against predefined ranges and continuing processing until the desired levels are reached.

Modern food processing facilities often employ automated systems with sensors and feedback loops to continuously monitor and adjust these parameters without significant human intervention. The predictable and repetitive nature of these tests makes them strong candidates for automation.
