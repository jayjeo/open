It involves physical manipulation of tools and objects, requiring dexterity, precision, and sensory-motor coordination. The task likely involves disassembling, cleaning, replacing parts, and reassembling the meters, all of which are manual activities.

However, there is a small cognitive component to this task. Diagnosing issues, determining the appropriate maintenance or repair procedures, and following technical instructions or guidelines require some level of perception, reasoning, and decision-making. Technicians need to understand how the meters function and apply their knowledge to properly maintain or repair them.

The process of physically adding air to tires or topping up fluids still requires human intervention, as does the decision-making process involved in determining exactly how much air or fluid to add. As such, while this task is primarily routine, it does contain elements of non-routine work, hence the score of 0.2.</td>

It involves physical activities such as visually inspecting fluid levels, manipulating tools or equipment to check tire pressure, and potentially adding fluids or air as needed. These actions require sensory-motor coordination, dexterity, and some level of physical effort.

However, there is a minor cognitive component to this task. The worker must remember the correct fluid types, optimal levels, and tire pressure for the specific vehicle. They also need to pay attention to the gauges or indicators and make simple decisions based on their readings. These cognitive elements prevent the task from being classified as a 0 (extremely manual).</td>

This task requires effective communication, collaboration, and information sharing among scientists to reach consensus on the most suitable approaches. While there might be some minor manual elements involved, such as using a computer or writing notes during the consultation process, the core of this task is heavily focused on cognitive aspects.
