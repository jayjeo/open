            <td>Explanation: Handling lines to moor vessels, tie them up to other vessels, or rig towing lines is primarily a manual task. It involves physical manipulation of ropes and lines, requiring dexterity, coordination, and physical effort. The task is performed using hands and body movements to secure the vessels properly.

However, there is a minor cognitive component involved. The person performing the task needs to understand the proper techniques for mooring, tying, and rigging lines. They must be aware of safety procedures and have knowledge of various knots and their applications. Decision-making skills are required to determine the appropriate lines and knots to use based on the situation.

On the routine side, there may be established protocols or standardized signals that crew members use to communicate, which could potentially be automated or recognized by computer vision systems. However, the task also requires interpreting and responding to these signals in real-time, adapting to the specific context and needs of the situation. This aspect introduces a non-routine component, as it demands human judgment, situational awareness, and the ability to handle unexpected or ambiguous signals.\n\nMoreover, coordinating work activities based on these signals requires a level of intuition and understanding of the overall workflow an", "reasoningGPT": "This task involves observing signals from other crew members to coordinate work activities, which requires human judgment and intuition to interpret non-verbal cues and react accordingly.
