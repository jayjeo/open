It involves physical manipulation of objects and tools, requiring dexterity and sensory-motor coordination. The act of replacing sprockets is a hands-on activity that necessitates manual skills.

However, there is a slight cognitive element in the task as well. Determining the need for repairs and distinguishing between minor and major repairs requires some level of perception, assessment, and decision-making. The worker must observe the condition of the sprockets, evaluate the extent of wear, and make a judgment call on whether a minor repair is sufficient or if major repairs are necessary.
