The cognitive aspects include perceiving the environment, making decisions about where objects should be placed, and communicating instructions to other workers. This requires mental processes such as spatial reasoning, decision making, and language use.

However, the task also has manual components, as the worker needs to physically point, gesture, or demonstrate the desired actions to guide the other workers effectively. The actual movement of the objects is performed by the other workers, but the directing worker still engages in some level of physical activity and sensory-motor coordination.
