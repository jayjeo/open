            <td>Explanation: Preparing repair cost estimates is primarily a cognitive task that involves mental processes such as analysis, calculation, and decision-making. It requires the ability to assess the extent of the damage, determine the necessary repairs, and estimate the costs associated with those repairs. This process involves critical thinking, problem-solving, and the application of knowledge and expertise in the relevant field.

However, there may be a minor manual component involved in preparing repair cost estimates, such as physically inspecting the damaged item or using tools to assess the extent of the damage. This manual aspect is relatively limited compared to the dominant cognitive processes required for the task.
