Therefore, while this task is primarily non-routine, the presence of some potentially routine elements prevents it from being classified as an extremely non-routine task. Hence, a score of 0.</td>

            <td>The task of designing or developing energy products using nanomaterials or nanoprocesses, such as micro-nano machining, is predominantly cognitive in nature. It requires a high degree of knowledge, understanding, and application of scientific and engineering principles, which are cognitive tasks. This involves problem-solving, decision-making, and learning, as well as the application of specialized knowledge. This task also likely involves the use of software and simulation tools, which require cognitive skills to operate. However, there may be some manual aspects involved, such as the handling and manipulation of materials or equipment in a laboratory setting, or the use of tools or machinery in the manufacturing process. These manual elements, although they are secondary to the cognitive elements</td>
            
            <td>Explanation: Designing or developing energy products using nanomaterials or nanoprocesses is a highly cognitive task. It requires extensive mental processes, including perception, thinking, reasoning, and decision making. The task involves understanding complex scientific concepts related to nanomaterials and nanoprocesses, such as their unique properties and behaviors at the nanoscale. It also requires applying this knowledge to design and develop innovative energy products.

The task demands problem-solving skills to address the challenges associated with working at the nanoscale, such as manipulating and controlling materials at the atomic or molecular level. It also requires creativity and critical thinking to design products that effectively harness the potential of nanomater</td>
