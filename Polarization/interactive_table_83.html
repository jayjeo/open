Routine aspects:
- The task involves a repetitive action of installing foam dams, which could be performed in a predictable manner.
- The process of installing foam dams may follow a standardized procedure, making it somewhat automatable.

Non-routine aspects:
- The task requires a judgment call to determine if new foam dams are required, which involves assessing the condition of the existing foam dams and the pinchwelds. This decision-making process relies on human discretion</td>
            
            <td>The task of installing new foam dams on pinchwelds, if required, is moderately routine. While it involves a degree of manual labor, the task itself is predictable and repetitive, making it potentially automatable. However, the conditional statement "if required" introduces an element of human judgment, as it implies that a decision must be made regarding the necessity of the task in each individual case. Therefore, although the task is primarily routine, the requirement for some level of human discretion prevents it from being classified as an extremely routine task.</td>

It involves the physical process of installing foam dams on pinchwelds, which requires the use of hands and sensory-motor coordination. It may involve some manipulation of tools or objects, such as the foam dams, and possibly tools to install them. However, there is a small cognitive element involved in determining if the foam dams are required, which is why the score is not 0. But, the cognitive aspect is minor compared to the manual work involved, hence a score closer to 0 is assigned.</td>
            
            <td>Explanation: Installing new foam dams on pinchwelds is primarily a manual task. It involves physical manipulation and dexterity to place the foam dams in the correct position on the pinchwelds. The task requires sensory-motor coordination and precise manual work.

However, there is a slight cognitive element in determining if the foam dams are required. This involves a quick assessment or inspection of the current state of the pinchwelds to decide whether new foam dams are necessary. But this cognitive aspect is relatively minor compared to the main physical work of actually installing the dams.
