This places it within the manual task category. However, it also requires some cognitive skills to understand how the demagnetizing machine works and to apply this knowledge to successfully demagnetize the mechanisms. This cognitive aspect is not as dominant as the manual aspect, but it is present nonetheless. Therefore, I would classify this task as being slightly more manual than cognitive, hence the score of 0.3.</td>
            
            <td>Explanation: Demagnetizing mechanisms using demagnetizing machines involves a combination of manual and cognitive elements. The manual aspect involves physically handling the mechanisms and operating the demagnetizing machines, which requires sensory-motor coordination and dexterity. However, the task also involves cognitive elements such as understanding the principles of magnetism, knowing how to properly use the demagnetizing machines, and determining when the mechanisms have been sufficiently demagnetized. The operator must also follow proper procedures and safety protocols, which involves cognitive processing and decision-making.
