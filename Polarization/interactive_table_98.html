            <td>Explanation: The task of putting price information on tickets, whether by hand or using a ticket-printing machine, is primarily a manual task. It involves physical manipulation of objects (tickets) and the use of hands or a machine to mark or print the price information. The sensory-motor coordination required for handwriting or operating the ticket-printing machine further emphasizes the manual nature of the task.

However, there is a minor cognitive component involved in reading and understanding the price information that needs to be marked on the tickets. This cognitive aspect is relatively minimal compared to the dominant manual characteristics of the task.

This task involves repetitive actions that follow a predefined pattern or prescription, making it predictable and suitable for automation.

Current technology, such as industrial robots or automated dispensing systems, can easily replicate the process of evenly distributing the materials over a surface based on programmed instructions. These systems can control the amount, pattern, and coverage of the materials with high precision and consistency, eliminating the need for human intervention in most cases.
