            <td>Explanation: Dumping refuse or recyclable materials at disposal sites is primarily a manual task. It involves physical activities such as lifting, carrying, and depositing materials using the hands and body. The task requires sensory-motor coordination, physical effort, and manipulation of objects, which are key characteristics of manual tasks.

However, there is a minor cognitive component to the task. The worker must identify and sort the materials based on whether they are refuse or recyclable, which requires some level of perception and decision-making. They also need to navigate to the appropriate disposal sites, which involves a basic level of spatial awareness and memory.

Despite these cognitive elements, the task is predominantly manual in nature.</td>

On the routine side, the process often involves filling out standardized forms, providing specific documentation, and following established procedures. Many aspects of the application process can be automated or guided by clear instructions.

However, there are also non-routine components to this task. Depending on the complexity of the permits or licenses required, human judgment may be necessary to determine which specific permits are needed, how to navigate the application process, and how to address any unique circumstances or exceptions that arise. Some level of human interaction and communication with the issuing authorities may be required to clarify requirements or resolve issues.</td>
