This task requires a high level of human input, intuition, and problem-solving skills. The individual performing this task needs to understand the drawings, interpret them correctly, communicate the details to the team, and make adjustments based on the team's feedback or the specifics of the project. These activities involve a significant degree of unpredictability as the drawings, the team's understanding, and the necessary adjustments can vary greatly from one project to another.
