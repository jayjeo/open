            <td>Explanation: Marking identification numbers, trademarks, grades, marketing data, sizes, or model numbers on products is primarily a manual task. It involves physical manipulation and dexterity to apply the markings to the products, likely using tools such as stamps, stencils, or labeling machines. The task requires sensory-motor coordination to accurately place the markings on the products.

However, there is a minor cognitive component involved in reading and interpreting the specific information to be marked on each product, such as ensuring the correct identification numbers, trademarks, grades, or sizes are applied. This requires a basic level of perception and attention to detail.

However, the process also involves cognitive aspects such as perception, attention to detail, and decision-making to determine the optimal placement of cuts or to maximize yields based on the provided specifications.

The manual components of the task include the physical handling and positioning of templates and materials, as well as the use of measuring tools. These actions require sensory-motor coordination, dexterity, and precision.
