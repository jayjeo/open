Scheduling software and automation tools can assist in generating schedules based on these parameters, reducing the need for manual input.

However, ensuring quality and timely service delivery introduces non-routine aspects. Managers must consider various factors, such as individual employee strengths, team dynamics, and unexpected changes in workload or staffing.

The manual aspect is present in the physical act of dividing the documents, which requires the use of hands and sensory-motor coordination. On the other hand, the cognitive aspect is evident in the need to ensure that parts are not misplaced, which requires attention, decision making, and possibly some problem-solving if the documents are complex or if there are many parts to keep track of. However, it leans slightly more towards the cognitive side as it requires a higher level of attention and decision-making skills to ensure no parts are misplaced.

            <td>Explanation: Reviewing documents such as purchase orders, sales tickets, charge slips, or hospital records to compute fees or charges due is primarily a cognitive task. It involves mental processes like perception (reading and interpreting the information in the documents), reasoning (understanding the fee or charge structures and applying them to the specific cases), and computation (calculating the amounts due based on the given information).

However, there is a minor manual component to this task, as it requires physically handling the documents and possibly using tools like a calculator or computer to input data and perform calculations. The sensory-motor coordination needed for these manual aspects is relatively low compared to the cognitive demands of the task.

Bank machines are designed to handle predictable, repetitive tasks like check processing, which involves standardized procedures and minimal need for human discretion or judgment.

The task of encoding checks involves inputting standardized information from the check into the bank machine, such as the check amount, date, and account details. This process follows a set routine and can be easily programmed into the machine. Similarly, canceling checks is a straightforward process that involves marking the check as void or processed, which can be done automatically by the bank machine once the check information is encoded.

On the routine side, scheduling often follows established patterns and guidelines, such as assigning shifts based on predefined roles, skills, and availability. Scheduling software and automation tools can assist in generating schedules based on these parameters, reducing the need for manual input.\n\nHowever, ensuring quality and timely service delivery introduces non-routine aspects.
