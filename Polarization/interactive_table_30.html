On the routine side, discussing product specifications, pricing, and availability is a relatively predictable process that could potentially be partially automated through online ordering systems or standardized communication protocols. However, the task also involves non-routine aspects, such as negotiating terms, building relationships, and addressing unique or unexpected issues that may arise during the discussions. These non-routine elements require human intuition, problem-solving skills, and the ability to adapt to various situations.\n\nWhile some parts of the vendor meeting process could be streamlined or assisted by technology, the core of the task relies on human interaction", "reasoningGPT": "This task is largely non-routine. Meeting with vendors or suppliers to discuss products used in repair work requires human interaction, negotiation skills, and the ability to make judgments based on the discussion. Although some elements of the task could potentially be automated (such as scheduling the meeting or maintaining a database of suppliers), the core task of discussing products and making decisions based on those discussions is not something that can be easily automated.

These activities involve mental processes such as perception, thinking, reasoning, decision-making, and information processing. However, there may be some manual aspects involved, such as handling product samples or using tools to demonstrate how a product works. Therefore, while this task is primarily cognitive, it has some manual elements, which is why it receives a score of 0.7.", "reasoning_cognitive_OPUS": "Explanation: Meeting with vendors or suppliers to discuss products used in repair work is primarily a cognitive task. It involves several mental processes such as communication, information exchange, understanding product specifications, evaluating options, and making decisions about which products to use. These discussions require the use of language comprehension, reasoning, memory, and problem-solving skills to ensure that the most suitable products are selected for the repair work.\n\nHowever, there is a slight manual component to this task as well.
