Routine aspects:
- Sharing basic medical information, such as injury status or recovery progress, can be relatively predictable and straightforward.
- Some aspects of this task could potentially be automated, such as generating standardized reports or using templates to communicate common medical conditions.

Non-routine aspects:
- Medical conditions can be complex and unpredictable, often requiring human judgment and expertise to interpret and communicate effectively.
