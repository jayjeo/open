These tasks involve following predefined specifications and guidelines based on the types of glass being processed. Once the initial setup is complete, the machine can operate with minimal human intervention, as long as the glass types remain consistent.

However, there is a slight non-routine element to this task. The operator may need to make adjustments based on their experience and judgment to ensure optimal results, especially if there are variations in the glass types or if issues arise during processing.

Manual aspects:
- Physically adjusting the machine press stroke lengths and pressures requires manual dexterity and manipulation of the equipment.
- Regulating oven temperatures may involve manually turning knobs or pressing buttons on the oven controls.

Cognitive aspects:
- Determining the appropriate stroke lengths, pressures, and oven temperatures for different glass types requires mental processing and decision-making based on knowledge and understanding of the materials and processes involved.
