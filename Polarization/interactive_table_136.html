There is a minor cognitive component in understanding which material is appropriate for each surface or hole and how to apply it correctly. The worker needs to make decisions about the right sealant or covering material and the proper technique for application. However, this cognitive aspect is relatively minimal compared to the dominant manual nature of the task.

The basic process of clearing a roof surface can be considered somewhat predictable and repetitive, which aligns with the definition of a routine task. However, the specific conditions encountered on each roof may vary significantly, requiring the worker to adapt and make judgments based on the unique situation.

Factors that lean towards a routine classification:
- The general process of removing unwanted materials from a roof is a repetitive task that follows a similar pattern across different projects.
