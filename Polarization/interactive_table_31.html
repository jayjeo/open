            <td>Explanation: The task of laying out mounting holes and drilling them with a power drill is primarily a manual task. It involves physical manipulation of tools (measuring instruments and power drill) and materials, requiring hand-eye coordination, dexterity, and precision. The use of the power drill, in particular, is a clear indicator of the manual nature of the task.

However, there is a minor cognitive component involved in the task. The process of laying out the mounting holes requires some level of perception, spatial reasoning, and decision-making to ensure proper placement and alignment of the holes. The use of measuring instruments also involves a basic level of cognitive processing to interpret and apply the measurements correctly.

            <td>Explanation: Operating an engine lathe to grind, file, and turn machine parts is primarily a manual task. It involves the use of hands, physical effort, and the manipulation of tools to shape and modify machine parts according to specific dimensions. The task requires dexterity, precision, and sensory-motor coordination to control the lathe and achieve the desired results.

However, there is a minor cognitive component involved in interpreting and understanding the dimensional specifications, which serve as a guide for the manual work. The operator needs to mentally process the specifications and translate them into the appropriate physical actions on the lathe.

Modern packaging machines are often highly automated and can perform repetitive packaging operations with minimal human intervention. Once the machine is set up and programmed, the operator's role is typically limited to monitoring the machine's performance, replenishing packaging materials, and addressing occasional malfunctions.

While some human oversight is still required to ensure the machine operates correctly and to handle any exceptions or issues that arise, the core packaging process itself is largely predictable and automatable.
