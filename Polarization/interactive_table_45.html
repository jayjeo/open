The task of directing or escorting mourners to parlors or chapels in which wakes or funerals are being held involves a high degree of human interaction and empathy, which cannot be automated. While the direction or escorting part could be considered routine, the context in which it takes place requires a level of sensitivity and understanding of human emotions that cannot be replicated by current automation technologies. The unpredictable nature of human emotions and the need for compassionate responses makes this task more non-routine than routine. Therefore, a score of 0.7 is assigned.</td>

While there is some level of unpredictability in the specifics of each malfunction, the overall process of documenting these issues is fairly standardized and could potentially be automated to some extent. For instance, sensors could be used to detect malfunctions and automated systems could record the specifics.

However, the task also includes a small manual component, as it may require physically interacting with the machine to identify the malfunction, thus the score is not a full 1.
