            <td>Explanation: Cleaning facilities is primarily a manual task that involves physical activities and skills. It requires the use of hands, the body, and sensory-motor coordination to perform tasks such as sweeping, mopping, dusting, and scrubbing. These activities involve dexterity, precision, physical effort, and manipulation of cleaning tools and objects.

However, there is a slight cognitive component to cleaning facilities. It involves some level of perception, decision making, and planning to determine which areas need cleaning, in what order to clean them, and which cleaning methods and products to use. It also requires attention to detail and the ability to recognize when an area is sufficiently clean.

Many warehouses and distribution centers use automated systems to pick, pack, and ship orders with minimal human intervention. However, placing orders for out-of-stock items introduces a slightly non-routine element to the task.

While inventory management systems can automatically generate reorder points and quantities based on predefined rules, human judgment may be required to assess factors such as anticipated demand, supplier reliability, and potential supply chain disruptions.

However, there is a minor cognitive element involved in ensuring proper fit and clearance. This requires some level of perception, judgment, and decision-making to determine whether the parts meet the required specifications. The worker must visually inspect the parts and make adjustments based on their assessment.

Some aspects of the task, such as identifying common pest issues and suggesting standard treatment options, can be considered relatively routine. There may be established protocols or guidelines that a professional can follow in many cases.\n\nHowever, each client's situation may present unique challenges or complexities that require a more tailored approach. Factors such as the specific type of pest, the extent of the infestation, the layout and characteristics of the affected property, and the client's preferences or constraints can introduce unpredictable variables. In these cases, the professional must use their expertise, critical thinking", "reasoningGPT": "This task leans more towards being a non-routine task, hence the score of 0.7. The task of recommending treatment and prevention methods for pest problems to clients requires a significant level of human creativity, intuition, and expertise. This is because pest problems can vary widely depending on the type of pests, the extent of the infestation, the location, and the client's specific circumstances and preferences. Therefore, it would be challenging to automate this task entirely, as it requires an understanding of the unique context of each situation, the ability to diagnose the problem, and the application of professional knowledge to recommend suitable solutions.

This involves problem-solving, decision-making, and information processing, all of which are cognitive tasks.

However, the process of calculating fumigant requirements may involve some non-routine elements, such as considering specific characteristics of the area being treated, assessing potential complications or obstacles, and applying professional judgment based on experience.\n\nEstimating the cost for the service pushes this task further into the non-routine category, as it likely requires considering various factors beyond just the fumigant calculations.
