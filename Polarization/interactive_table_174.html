The use of standardized equipment and protocols for these screening procedures suggests a level of predictability and potential for automation. For example, pure tone screening involves presenting tones at specific frequencies and intensities, which could be automated using a computerized system. Similarly, otoacoustic and immittance screening rely on measuring specific physiological responses, which could be analyzed by software algorithms.

The task requires cognitive skills such as perception, attention to detail, and decision-making to evaluate the cleanliness, safety, and availability of supplies in the birthing environment. The assessor must use their knowledge and judgment to determine whether the environment meets the necessary standards.

However, the task also involves some manual components, such as physically inspecting the space, handling and checking supplies, and potentially making minor adjustments or preparations. The assessor may need to move around the room, open cabinets, or use their hands to examine equipment.
