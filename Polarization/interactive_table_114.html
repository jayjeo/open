The task requires the ability to organize and manage information effectively, which relies on cognitive skills.

However, there may be a minor manual component involved, such as physically handling and sorting delivery documents or using a computer to input data. These manual aspects are likely secondary to the main cognitive demands of the task.

Given the strong emphasis on cognitive processes and the relatively minor manual elements, a score of 0.7 is assigned. This score reflects the predominantly cognitive nature of the task</td>

            <td>Explanation: Calculating figures such as labor requirements, material quantities, manufacturing costs, or wages is primarily a cognitive task. It involves mental processes like quantitative reasoning, mathematical computations, and analysis of pricing schedules or other data. These activities require skills in arithmetic, problem-solving, and information processing.

The use of tools like adding machines, calculators, or computers to assist with the calculations does introduce a minor manual component. However, the essence of the task lies in the cognitive aspects of determining the appropriate figures and performing the necessary computations. The manual involvement of operating the calculating devices is secondary and in service of the main cognitive work.
