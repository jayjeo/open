The manual aspects include physically guiding people through spaces, which requires sensory-motor coordination and physical effort. However, the task also has significant cognitive components. Tour guides must remember and recall information about the places they are touring, engage in language comprehension and production when interacting with tour participants, and make decisions about how to best lead the tour based on the group's needs and interests. They also need to be attentive to the group's safety and engagement.

It requires the use of mental processes such as memory (recalling information about the points of interest), language comprehension and production (understanding questions and formulating appropriate responses), and communication skills. The task involves conveying information, which is a form of knowledge transfer and requires cognitive abilities to effectively engage with the audience.

While there may be some manual elements involved, such as gesturing or pointing to specific locations, these are secondary to the main cognitive aspects of the task. The core of the activity lies in the mental processes of recalling information, understanding questions, and providing relevant answers.

            <td>Explanation: Routing emergency calls is primarily a cognitive task that involves decision-making, problem-solving, and information processing. The operator must quickly assess the nature of the emergency based on the information provided by the caller, determine the appropriate response, and route the call to the correct emergency service (police, fire, or ambulance). This requires mental processes such as active listening, critical thinking, and decision-making under pressure.

However, there is a minor manual component to this task, which involves the physical act of operating the phone system or computer to transfer the call to the appropriate destination. This manual aspect is relatively small compared to the cognitive elements of the task.

Furthermore, using a radio-telephone to communicate effectively involves language comprehension. While there are manual elements in this task, the cognitive aspects seem to play a more dominant role, hence the score of 0.6.", "reasoning_cognitive_OPUS": "Explanation: Contacting security staff members using radio-telephones involves a combination of manual and cognitive elements. The manual aspects include physically handling the radio-telephone device, pressing buttons, and speaking into the microphone. These actions require some level of sensory-motor coordination and dexterity.\n\nHowever, the task also involves cognitive components. The person must determine when it is necessary to contact security staff, which requires decision-making and judgment. They need to assess the situation and decide if it warrants contacting security. Additionally, communicating effectively over the radio-telephone requires language comprehension and expression skills, which are cognitive abilities.\n\nGiven the presence of both manual and cognitive elements,"}];
