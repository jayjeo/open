2. Analyzing the different functions or segments of the event (e.g., cocktail hour, dinner, dancing) to match the music accordingly.

3. Applying knowledge of various musical genres, artists, and songs to select suitable tracks for each part of the event.

4. Using critical thinking and decision-making skills to curate a cohesive and engaging playlist that flows well and enhances the overall event experience.
