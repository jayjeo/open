On the manual side, maintaining cleanliness could involve physical activities such as cleaning surfaces, properly disposing of waste, and arranging tools or equipment in a safe manner. However, the cognitive aspect seems to be slightly more dominant as the individual needs to understand and apply the standards before any manual work can be carried out. Therefore, the task is classified as moderately cognitive.</td>

The cognitive aspects include understanding and applying safety regulations, assessing potential hazards, and making decisions to maintain a safe environment. This requires mental processes such as perception, reasoning, and problem-solving.

However, the task also involves manual elements, such as physically cleaning the lab, handling equipment, and manipulating objects to meet safety standards. These activities require physical effort, dexterity, and sensory-motor coordination.

Given the presence of both cognitive and manual components, the task leans slightly towards the cognitive side due to the importance of mental processes in maintaining safety standards. However, the</td>
