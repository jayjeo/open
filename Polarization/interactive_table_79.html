- Some supervisory tasks, such as scheduling shifts, assigning tasks, and monitoring attendance, can be partially automated or assisted by software tools.
- Certain oversight responsibilities may follow predictable patterns or established protocols.

Non-routine aspects:

The manual aspect of this task is evident in the physical action of marking the tires with chalk. This requires the use of hands, sensory-motor coordination, and a degree of precision. The cognitive aspect is present in the need to record the time of marking and to return at regular intervals. This involves memory, attention, and decision-making skills, as the individual must remember the time of marking, decide when to return, and determine whether the parking time limit has been exceeded. However, the manual aspect seems slightly more dominant, hence the score of 0.6.</td>
