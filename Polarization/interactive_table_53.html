However, the part of the task that requires detailed analysis of certain claims might require human intervention, as this could involve making judgments based on the specific context of each claim. This element of the task is not entirely predictable and might require some level of human discretion, which is why the task is not scored as completely routine.

However, the specific case of unfiled taxes may introduce non-routine aspects. Determining why the taxes were not filed, gathering the necessary information from the taxpayer, and ensuring compliance with regulations may require human intervention and judgment. Revenue service representatives may need to communicate with the taxpayer, investigate the specific circumstances, and make decisions based on their findings.

            <td>This task has elements of both routine and non-routine characteristics. On the one hand, preparing tax returns involves a lot of routine information processing, such as calculating income, deductions, and tax liabilities based on standard formulas and tax tables. These activities are predictable and can be automated to a large extent, which would suggest a routine task. However, the task also requires handling unpredictable situations and resolving exceptions. For instance, the taxpayer's financial situation may be complex, involving various sources of income, deductions, and credits. The tax laws and regulations may also change from year to year, requiring the revenue service to update its procedures and calculations accordingly.

1. Identifying cases where taxes have not been filed by a taxpayer.
2. Understanding the tax laws, regulations, and requirements for filing tax returns.
3. Communicating with the relevant revenue service to request the preparation of the tax return.
4. Providing necessary information and documentation to the revenue service to facilitate the preparation of the return.
5. Reviewing and verifying the prepared tax return for accuracy and completeness.
