The actual stretching exercises themselves are likely to be fairly predictable and repetitive, following a set routine that could potentially be demonstrated by a pre-recorded video or an automated system. This aspect of the task leans towards being routine.

However, leading the exercises also requires a level of human interaction and judgment. The person leading the stretches may need to adapt the routine based on the specific needs of the team members on a given day, such as adjusting for injuries or fatigue. They may also need to provide motivation, answer questions, and ensure that everyone is performing the stretches</td>
            
            <td>The task of leading stretching exercises for team members prior to games or practices is slightly more non-routine than routine. While the exercises themselves may be predictable and repetitive (routine characteristics), the task requires a degree of human intuition and judgment that cannot be fully automated. The leader needs to observe the team members, provide real-time feedback, and adjust the exercises based on each individual's needs or the team's overall performance, which are non-routine characteristics. The leader may also have to handle unpredictable situations, such as injuries or unexpected incidents during the exercises. Therefore, the task leans more towards non-routine, but it does contain some routine elements, resulting in a score of 0.7.</td>

However, it also requires some cognitive elements, such as understanding the correct way to perform each stretch, knowing the order of the exercises, and being able to explain and demonstrate them to others. Therefore, it is not exclusively manual. The score of 0.6 reflects that while the task is largely manual, there is a significant cognitive component as well.</td>

The cognitive aspects include understanding the proper stretching techniques, remembering the sequence of exercises, and communicating instructions to the team. The manual components involve physically demonstrating the stretches and using one's body to guide the team through the exercises.

However, the task leans slightly more towards the cognitive side because it requires knowledge of stretching routines, the ability to plan and structure the session, and the need to monitor and correct the team's form. The manual aspects, while present, are relatively straightforward and do not require a high level of dexterity or precision.</td>

The basic task of pushing a wheelchair or providing standing support can be considered somewhat routine, as it follows a predictable pattern and does not require a high level of creativity or problem-solving skills. However, the task also involves dealing with unpredictable situations that may arise during patient transport, such as managing patient discomfort, navigating obstacles, or responding to sudden changes in a patient's condition. These aspects introduce a non-routine component to the task.

While the physical act of pushing a wheelchair or providing standing support could potentially be automated to some degree, the unpredictability of patient needs and potential for medical emergencies requires the presence and attention of a human. This task is not fully routine due to the need for human oversight and discretion in handling potential patient needs or emergencies. However, it leans more towards the routine side as the main activities (moving patients via wheelchair or providing standing support) are repetitive and predictable in nature.

The salesperson needs to understand the customer's requirements, suggest appropriate products, explain the benefits of different options, and convince the customer to make a purchase. These are all cognitive tasks. However, there may also be some manual aspects involved in this task, such as handling the products, showing them to the customers, or arranging them on the shelves.
