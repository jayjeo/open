In addition, effective training often requires the ability to adapt the approach based on the learner's understanding and feedback, which is a capability not yet fully replicable by current automation technologies. Therefore, this task leans more towards being non-routine, but not to the extreme as it does contain some routine elements.", "cognitivescore": 0.75, "cognitivescoreGPT": 0.7, "cognitivescoreOPUS": 0.8, "reasoning_cognitive_GPT": "The task of training users and answering questions is predominantly cognitive in nature. It involves understanding the subject matter, communicating effectively, and responding to inquiries, which are all cognitive processes. However, there may be some manual aspects involved, such as demonstrating how to use a tool or equipment, writing on a board, or using a computer to show examples or presentations. Therefore, while this task is primarily cognitive, the possible manual elements present prevent it from being classified as an extremely cognitive task.", "reasoning_cognitive_OPUS": "Explanation: Training users and answering questions is primarily a cognitive task. It involves mental processes such as understanding the users' needs, retrieving relevant information from memory, organizing thoughts, and communicating knowledge effectively. The task requires skills in perception, reasoning, learning, and language comprehension to interpret questions and provide appropriate responses. While there might be some manual elements involved, such as demonstrating procedures or using visual aids, the core of the task lies in the cognitive domain of processing and conveying information. The high level of cognitive engagement and the relatively minor manual aspects justify a score of 0.8, indicating a strongly cognitive task with a slight manual component."}];
