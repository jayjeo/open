It requires the use of hands, physical effort, and the manipulation of tools such as bandsaws, sanding machines, machine grinders, hand files, and scrapers. The task demands dexterity, precision, and sensory-motor coordination to shape the bars accurately.

However, there is a slight cognitive element involved in understanding the relationship between the material removal and the resulting tones. The worker needs to have some knowledge of how the physical modifications affect the instrument's sound.

While on one hand, it can be automated to a certain extent with machinery designed to detect the dullness of cutting tools and replace them, it still requires a level of human oversight. For instance, a human worker might be needed to confirm the dullness of the tool, ensure the correct replacement tool is used, and verify the replacement process is done correctly. However, because the task is generally predictable and repetitive, and the need for human discretion is limited, it leans more towards the routine end of the spectrum. Therefore, a score of 0.3 is appropriate.</td>

            <td>Explanation: Removing and replacing dull cutting tools is primarily a manual task, as it involves physical manipulation of objects using hands and tools. The task requires dexterity, precision, and physical effort to remove the dull tools and replace them with sharp ones. However, there is a minor cognitive component involved in determining when a cutting tool is dull and needs replacement, as well as selecting the appropriate replacement tool. This cognitive aspect prevents the task from being classified as an extremely manual task (0), but the manual characteristics still dominate.

The process of moving items from one location to another using these mechanical devices is predictable and can be largely automated with current technology.\n\nAutomated guided vehicles (AGVs) and robotic systems are increasingly being used in manufacturing and warehousing environments to handle material transportation tasks.
