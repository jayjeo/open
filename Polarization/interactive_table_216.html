These technologies can identify and classify certain features, such as buildings, roads, or vegetation, based on predefined patterns and rules.

However, the task also requires non-routine skills, particularly when dealing with complex or ambiguous imagery. Human intuition and expertise are often necessary to accurately interpret subtle details, contextual clues, or anomalies that automated systems may miss. Analysts must use their judgment to resolve conflicts between different interpretations and draw meaningful conclusions from the photographs.</td>
            
            <td>The task of interpreting aerial or ortho photographs falls more towards the non-routine category, but it's not entirely non-routine. While the process of capturing these photographs can be automated, the interpretation of the images requires a human touch. It involves a level of pattern recognition and decision-making that can be challenging for current automation technologies to replicate. However, with advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, it's possible that some aspects of this task could eventually be automated, reducing the level of human input required. Therefore, it's not an extremely non-routine task, but it's closer to non-routine than routine.</td>
