Routine aspects:
- The process of applying fluoride or sealants is generally predictable and follows a set of standard steps.
- The materials used (fluoride, sealants) are consistent and do not require significant adaptation for each patient.
- The application process itself is largely mechanical and does not require a high degree of creativity or problem-solving.

The process of applying fingerprint powder and using brushes or tape to lift prints is a standardized, predictable procedure that suggests a routine nature. However, fire scenes present unpredictable and variable conditions that require human judgment and adaptation.

The task requires a trained expert to visually examine the scene, identify suitable surfaces, and determine the appropriate dusting techniques based on the surface type and fire damage.

- Physical movement is required to conduct the rounds, which involves walking or navigating through the designated areas.
- Sensory perception is necessary to observe and detect any potential safety or security issues.

Cognitive aspects:
- Attention and vigilance are essential to actively monitor the environment during the rounds.
- Decision-making skills are needed to assess whether a situation is safe or if it requires intervention.
- Memory is involved in recalling the layout of the areas, the residents, and any specific safety protocols.
