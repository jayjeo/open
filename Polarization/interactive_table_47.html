            <td>Explanation: Computing credit terms, discounts, shipment charges, or rates for goods or services to complete billing documents is primarily a cognitive task. It involves mental processes such as calculation, analysis, and decision-making based on predefined rules or guidelines. The task requires the ability to understand and apply mathematical concepts, interpret data, and make accurate computations.

While there may be a minor manual component in entering the data into a system or physically handling the billing documents, the core of the task lies in the cognitive processes of determining the appropriate figures and ensuring the accuracy of the calculations. The manual aspects are secondary to the mental skills required to complete the task successfully.

            <td>Explanation: The task of following procedures to secure courtrooms or exhibits involves a blend of routine and non-routine elements. On one hand, the procedures for securing these spaces and items are likely well-defined and standardized, which lends itself to a degree of predictability and potential for automation. Security systems, such as cameras, alarms, and access control measures, can handle some aspects of monitoring and controlling access to courtrooms and exhibits.

However, the task also requires human judgment and adaptability to handle unpredictable situations that may arise. Courtrooms can be dynamic environments where unexpected events or security breaches may occur, requiring security personnel to think critically and respond appropriately.</td>
            
            <td>This task, while having a procedural element that could potentially be automated, still requires a significant degree of human discretion and judgment. Following procedures to secure courtrooms or exhibits such as money, drugs, or weapons involves a level of physical interaction and decision-making that, while potentially routine, is not yet fully automatable by current technology. It requires a human to evaluate the situation, make decisions based on their observations, and physically handle items. Additionally, the task might involve unpredictable situations, such as dealing with different types of exhibits or handling unexpected security issues, which would require human intervention. Therefore, this task leans towards being routine but has significant non-routine elements, resulting in a score of 0.3.</td>

On the manual side, the task may require physical actions such as handling and securing items like money, drugs, or weapons, which involves sensory-motor coordination and dexterity. However, the task also has significant cognitive components. Following procedures requires understanding, memory, and application of specific protocols and rules. Securing a courtroom or exhibit also involves perception, attention to detail, and decision-making to ensure proper handling and security measures are implemented. The task requires a level of situational awareness and judgment.
