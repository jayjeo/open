The instructor must also use problem-solving skills to adapt the teaching approach to the client's needs and learning style.

However, the task also involves manual components, as the instructor may need to physically guide the client through various travel situations or exercises. This could include demonstrating how to use public transportation, navigate sidewalks and crosswalks, or handle money for fares. The use of simulated travel situations may also require manual setup and manipulation of materials.
