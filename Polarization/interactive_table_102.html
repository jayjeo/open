However, the act of instructing others introduces non-routine aspects. Effective instruction requires adapting to the needs and learning styles of individual workers, answering questions, and providing guidance when they encounter difficulties or unique situations. The instructor must use judgment and interpersonal skills to communicate complex ideas and troubleshoot problems that arise during the learning process.</td>

While it involves machines and potentially repetitive tasks, the aspect of instruction requires a level of human intuition and adaptability that is not easily automated. The human instructor must be able to understand the unique learning styles and needs of different workers, answer unexpected questions, and adapt their teaching methods as needed. Furthermore, the set-up and operation of machines can vary greatly depending on the specific machine and task, adding an additional layer of unpredictability. Therefore, while there are routine elements in the task, the overall nature of the task leans more towards non-routine.</td>
