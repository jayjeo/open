            <td>Explanation: Briefing flight crews about flight details, destinations, duties, and responsibilities is primarily a cognitive task. It involves conveying information, which requires mental processes such as memory, language comprehension, and communication skills. The briefer needs to understand the flight details, organize the information, and effectively communicate it to the crew. This task relies heavily on cognitive abilities to process and share information.

However, there might be a small manual component if the briefer uses physical materials like maps, charts, or documents during the briefing. They may need to handle and reference these items. But the core of the task - understanding and communicating the essential flight information - is a cognitive activity.

On one hand, the process of collecting receipts and signatures can be standardized and follows a predictable pattern, which leans towards the routine aspect. However, the task also involves interacting with various individuals and handling potential exceptions or issues that may arise during the delivery process, which introduces a non-routine component.\n\nCollecting payment for services adds another layer of non-routine characteristics to the task. It requires communication skills, adaptability, and the ability to handle different payment methods or resolve any discrepancies that may occur.

The task of obtaining receipts or signatures for delivered goods is a predictable and repetitive activity that could potentially be automated, for example, through electronic receipt or signature systems. The collection of payment for services could also be automated through digital payment systems. However, the phrase \"when required\" indicates that there is a degree of human judgment involved in determining when these actions are necessary, which introduces an element of non-routine work. Additionally, this task may involve interacting with customers, which can be unpredictable and may require human skills such as communication and problem-solving.
