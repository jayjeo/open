It requires collaboration, problem-solving, and the ability to adapt to various factors such as the needs of students, the specific curriculum, and the resources available. Although there are some elements of the task that could potentially be automated, such as scheduling, the majority of the task requires human intuition and cannot be replicated by current automation technologies. This task also involves unpredictable situations, as educators often need to adjust their plans based on the progress and needs of their students.

1. Each child's progress and needs are unique, requiring individualized discussions and assessments.
2. Determining priorities and resource needs for each child involves complex problem-solving and decision-making based on the specific situation.
3. The meetings require interpersonal communication, empathy, and the ability to handle potentially emotional or sensitive conversations, which are inherently human skills.
