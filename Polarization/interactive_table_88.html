            <td>Explanation: Applying nail polish is primarily a manual task that involves physical manipulation and sensory-motor coordination. The task requires the use of hands and tools (the nail polish brush) to apply the undercoat and colored or clear polish onto the nails with precision and dexterity. The physical aspect of the task, including the manual application of the polish and the need for a steady hand, dominates the cognitive elements.

However, there are some minor cognitive components involved, such as deciding on the appropriate amount of polish to apply, ensuring even distribution, and possibly considering the color choice or design. These cognitive aspects are relatively minimal compared to the manual nature of the task.

            <td>Explanation: Promoting and selling nail care products involves a combination of cognitive and manual elements. The cognitive aspects include understanding the products, their features and benefits, and effectively communicating this information to potential customers. This requires knowledge, memory, reasoning, and language skills to persuade and influence others. Additionally, there is a need for problem-solving and decision-making when addressing customer concerns or objections.

However, the task also involves manual components, particularly when demonstrating the products. This may include handling the products, applying them to nails, or showing various techniques. These actions require physical dexterity, precision, and sensory-motor coordination.
