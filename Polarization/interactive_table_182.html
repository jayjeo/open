            <td>Explanation: Assessing urgent and emergent health conditions primarily involves cognitive processes such as perception, thinking, reasoning, and decision making based on the available data. The task requires the mental ability to interpret and analyze physiologically and technologically derived data, which are key cognitive skills. The healthcare professional must use their knowledge and critical thinking to accurately diagnose and determine the appropriate course of action for the patient's condition.

However, there may be a minor manual component involved in this task, such as physically examining the patient or operating technological devices to gather data. These manual aspects are likely to be secondary to the dominant cognitive processes required for assessing and making decisions based on the collected information.

Nurses and doctors must interpret subtle cues from patients, such as facial expressions, body language, and verbal descriptions of pain.
