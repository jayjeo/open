Some aspects of programming can be considered routine, such as following established coding conventions, using standard libraries, and adhering to predefined specifications. These routine components are predictable and can be partially automated using modern development tools and frameworks.

However, programming also requires non-routine problem-solving skills, especially when designing algorithms, optimizing performance, or debugging complex issues. Programmers often need to think creatively to develop efficient and elegant solutions to unique challenges. They must also adapt to evolving technologies and handle edge cases that may not be easily addressed by automated systems.
