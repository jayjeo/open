The cognitive aspects include monitoring environmental factors, making decisions based on plant requirements, and adjusting settings accordingly. This requires an understanding of plant physiology, environmental controls, and the ability to interpret data from sensors.

However, there are also manual components to this task. Depending on the level of automation, the person may need to physically adjust equipment, such as opening or closing vents, turning valves, or manipulating control panels. They may also need to inspect the systems, perform maintenance, or make repairs, which involve manual dexterity and physical effort.

While certain aspects of this task can be computerized, such as scanning and interpreting structured data from records or schedules, there may be instances where human judgment is necessary to handle exceptions or make decisions based on the information.\n\nFor example, an automated system could process standard orders and generate corresponding shipping instructions.

However, the task also requires some level of human discretion to determine the required activities based on the information in these documents.
