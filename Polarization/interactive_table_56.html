It involves carefully analyzing academic records, which requires perception, attention to detail, and reasoning skills to determine if the student has fulfilled the necessary criteria. This aspect of the task is heavily focused on information processing and decision making.

Writing letters of recommendation also leans strongly towards being a cognitive task. It involves retrieving relevant information from memory about the student's performance, skills, and character. The writer must then use language skills to effectively communicate this information in a persuasive manner. Constructing a well-written letter requires planning, organizing thoughts, and conveying ideas clearly.
