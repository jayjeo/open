This task is largely predictable and can be significantly automated using computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) or similar software.

However, there may be instances where human input is required to interpret and input data accurately, especially if the service records are not standardized or if there are unique circumstances surrounding the maintenance activities. Additionally, analyzing service records to identify trends, make decisions, or troubleshoot issues may require human intuition and judgment.
