It involves conveying knowledge, explaining concepts, and guiding learners through the mental processes and decision-making required for these procedures. The instructor must use their expertise, memory, and reasoning skills to effectively communicate and teach the subject matter.

While ophthalmologic procedures themselves have manual components, such as handling instruments and performing precise physical tasks, the act of instructing others focuses more on the cognitive aspects. The instructor must break down complex procedures into understandable steps, answer questions, and provide feedback to ensure proper understanding and learning.

2. Memory and recall: The presenter must remember key points, facts, and examples to include in the presentation.

3. Reasoning and problem-solving: The presenter may need to answer questions, provide explanations, and adapt the content based on the audience's understanding and reactions.

4. Attention and focus: Delivering a presentation requires maintaining focus and directing the audience's attention to important aspects of the content.
