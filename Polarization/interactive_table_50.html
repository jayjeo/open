However, there is a slight element of non-routine judgment required in determining when a malfunction is severe enough to warrant stopping the machines or notifying supervisors. The human operator may need to assess the nature of the malfunction and make a decision based on their experience and understanding of the machines' operation.

However, the task also requires human discretion and judgment to adapt to unpredictable situations, such as changes in the work environment or unexpected issues with the materials. Therefore, while the task has some routine elements, it also has non-routine aspects that prevent it from being fully automatable.</td>

However, there is a manual aspect as well, as the individual may need to demonstrate or physically participate in the moving of stakes, blocks, anchors, cables, or materials. The cognitive aspect seems to be more dominant because the individual is directing others and making decisions about where and how objects should be moved. This requires an understanding of the task at hand, the ability to communicate effectively, and the ability to make decisions based on the situation.
