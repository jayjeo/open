            <td>Explanation: Authorizing payment of valid claims and determining the method of payment is primarily a cognitive task. It involves several mental processes and decision-making steps:

1. Evaluating the validity of claims: This requires analyzing the claim information, comparing it against established criteria or policies, and making a judgment on its validity. This is a cognitive process involving reasoning and decision-making.

2. Determining the method of payment: Once a claim is deemed valid, deciding on the appropriate payment method involves considering factors such as the claimant's preferences, available payment options, and any relevant policies or guidelines. This requires weighing different options and making a choice, which are cognitive processes.

Therefore, a score of 0.7 is appropriate as it leans more towards cognitive but also acknowledges the potential for some manual involvement.", "reasoning_cognitive_OPUS": "Explanation: The task of locating new materials and directing their acquisition and display involves a blend of cognitive and manual elements. \n\nCognitive aspects include:\n- Researching and identifying suitable new materials, which requires mental processes like information gathering, analysis, and decision making.\n- Planning the acquisition process, considering factors like cost, logistics, and timing.\n- Determining how the materials should be displayed, which involves creative thinking and visual planning.\n\nManual aspects include:\n- Physically handling and examining materials during the acquisition process.\n- Arranging the physical display of the materials, which requires manual dexterity and spatial manipulation.\n\nThe task leans slightly more towards the"}];
