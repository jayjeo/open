While certain elements of this task can be automated, such as tracking attendance through digital systems or sending automated notifications for tardiness, the bulk of the task requires human judgment and discretion. Discipline enforcement often involves interpreting situations, understanding context, and making decisions based on a variety of unpredictable factors. It requires a human to handle exceptions and unpredictable situations that automated systems and programs cannot adequately address.
