The action of plating small objects like nuts or bolts doesn't require much human discretion or unpredictable judgement, making it a good candidate for automation. However, there may be some minimal human intervention required to ensure the machine is functioning properly, to load the objects, or to handle any potential exceptions or errors that might occur during the process. This slight level of human oversight prevents the task from being classified as an extremely routine task with a score of 0.

Many aspects of welding can be automated using robotic welding systems, particularly in mass production settings where the same welding operations are repeated consistently. These systems can perform precise, uniform welds on a variety of materials, reducing the need for human intervention.\n\nHowever, welding also requires a degree of human judgment and adaptability, especially when dealing with unique or complex welding scenarios.

Industrial robots are indeed capable of performing welding tasks on assembly lines, which makes this task lean towards being routine.
