- Sensory-motor skills are used to feel for a pulse and observe chest movements.

Cognitive aspects:
- Knowledge and understanding of human anatomy and physiology are necessary to locate pulse points and recognize signs of life.

While there are aspects of this task that could be considered routine, such as monitoring a specific area, the majority of it requires a human to interpret and respond to situations that are often complex and vary greatly. For example, determining who is a 'suspicious person' or what constitutes 'unusual activity' requires human intuition and decision-making skills that cannot currently be replicated by automation technologies. The need to investigate these situations further emphasizes the non-routine nature of this task, as it requires problem-solving skills and the ability to adapt to new information.
