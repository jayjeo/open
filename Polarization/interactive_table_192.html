They may also need to pay attention to details, such as ensuring that the right items are in the right rooms, or the quantity of items required for each room. Therefore, while this task is primarily manual, it does involve some cognitive processes, which is why it's scored slightly towards the manual end of the moderate range.</td>

It involves physical activities such as carrying, lifting, and placing items in their designated locations within the patient rooms. The task requires sensory-motor coordination, dexterity, and physical effort to handle and manipulate the hygiene items.

However, there is a minor cognitive component to this task. The person restocking the rooms needs to remember which items need to be replenished in each room and ensure that the correct items are placed in their appropriate locations. They may also need to keep track of inventory levels and communicate with other staff members about restocking needs.

            <td>Explanation: Changing soiled linens, such as bed linens, drapes, or cubicle curtains, is primarily a manual task. It involves physical activities and skills, including handling and manipulating the linens, removing the soiled ones, and replacing them with clean ones. The task requires dexterity, physical effort, and sensory-motor coordination to remove and replace the linens properly.

While there may be a minor cognitive component in terms of deciding which linens need changing, remembering the proper procedure for changing them, or determining the correct placement of the clean linens, these cognitive aspects are minimal compared to the dominant manual nature of the task.
