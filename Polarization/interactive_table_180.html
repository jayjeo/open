It involves mental processes like planning, decision-making, and problem-solving to develop and oversee the implementation of validation protocols. Creating protocols requires a deep understanding of the subject matter, critical thinking to identify potential issues, and the ability to design a systematic approach to address them. Testing involves analyzing results, interpreting data, and making judgments based on the findings.

However, there may be some manual elements involved in the process, such as physically setting up test environments, handling equipment, or documenting results. These manual aspects are likely to be minor compared to the overall cognitive nature of the task.</td>
