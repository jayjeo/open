The process involves installing strips of insulating material around doors and windows to seal gaps and prevent air leakage. This task is predictable and can be easily automated using robotic systems or specialized machinery.

The steps involved in applying weather-stripping are straightforward and repetitive:

1. Measure the dimensions of the doors and windows.
2. Cut the weather-stripping material to the appropriate lengths.
3. Clean the surfaces where the weather-stripping will be applied.
