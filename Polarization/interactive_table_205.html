Industrial robots equipped with vision systems could be programmed to detect scratches on pinchwelds and precisely apply primer to those locations. Timers and sensors could determine when the primer has dried sufficiently before moving the primed piece to the next stage of production.

The process of developing film using chemicals and specialized equipment follows a predictable, step-by-step procedure that can be largely automated. Modern film processing labs often employ automated machines to handle the majority of the developing and printing process, reducing the need for human intervention in these routine aspects of the task.\n\nHowever, the task also involves some non-routine elements, particularly in the use of touch-up tools. Retouching and enhancing the quality of the printed photographs may require human judgment, artistic skills, and creativity to achieve the desired results.

The process of developing film is generally standard and can be automated to a certain extent. However, the use of touch-up tools suggests that there is a level of human discretion needed to ensure the quality of the final product. This may include adjusting the image, correcting colors, or removing imperfections, which requires a level of creativity and intuition. Although the task is largely routine, the need for human input in the touch-up process prevents it from being classified as fully routine.
