The manual part comes into play when physically resetting the machine, which may involve pressing buttons, flipping switches, or other forms of physical interaction with the machine. This requires sensory-motor coordination and the use of hands, which falls under the definition of a manual task. On the other hand, the cognitive aspect is involved as well. The worker needs to understand when and how to reset the machine, which requires perception, decision-making, and potentially problem-solving if issues arise during the resetting process. However, it seems that the cognitive aspects are not as intensive as the manual ones, hence a score closer to the manual side of the", "reasoning_cognitive_OPUS": "Explanation: Resetting slot machines after payoffs is primarily a manual task. It involves physical manipulation of the machines, likely requiring the use of hands, precise movements, and possibly tools. The task is focused on the mechanical aspects of the machines rather than mental processes.\n\nHowever, there may be a minor cognitive component in terms of understanding the machine's operation, recognizing when a reset is needed based on the machine's state, and following proper procedures. This prevents assigning a score of 0, as the task is not entirely devoid of cognitive elements.\n\nNonetheless, the physical, manual nature of the task is the dominant characteristic.

Some aspects of the task, such as resolving common issues like coin jams, can be fairly predictable and may follow a set of established procedures, leaning towards the routine end of the spectrum. However, troubleshooting machine tilts and other problems may require a degree of human judgment and adaptability to diagnose and resolve issues that do not have a clear, predefined solution.
