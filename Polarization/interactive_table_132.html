Quality verification also involves cognitive processes to determine if the equipment meets necessary standards and is suitable for the intended use.

However, the task also includes manual components, as physically handling the equipment is necessary to count quantities and closely examine items to assess their condition and quality. This requires sensory-motor coordination and physical manipulation of objects.
