            <td>Explanation: Reviewing facts of incidents to determine if criminal acts or statute violations were involved is primarily a cognitive task. It requires mental processes such as perception, reasoning, and decision making to analyze the available information and compare it against legal standards or definitions of criminal acts and statute violations.

The task involves carefully examining the details and circumstances of each incident, which engages cognitive skills like attention to detail and information processing. Determining whether an incident constitutes a criminal act or violates a statute necessitates an understanding of relevant laws and the ability to apply that knowledge to the specific facts of the case. This requires higher-level cognitive functions such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and judgment.

            <td>This task involves monitoring traffic to ensure motorists observe traffic regulations and exhibit safe driving procedures. While some aspects of this task may be automated, such as traffic cameras capturing speeding violations or red light infractions, the task requires a significant amount of human input and judgement. 

The unpredictability of traffic situations and motorist behavior necessitates human discretion to adequately address. For instance, an officer may need to make judgement calls in situations where a motorist's actions could be dangerous but not necessarily against traffic regulations. Similarly, the officer may need to decide when to issue a warning versus a ticket, which involves judgement based on the specific situation.

            <td>Explanation: Reviewing inventory and sales records to prepare reports is primarily a cognitive task. It involves mental processes such as perception (reading and interpreting data), thinking (analyzing trends and patterns), and decision making (determining what information to include in the reports). The task requires skills like information processing, attention to detail, and problem-solving to ensure accurate and relevant reporting.

While there may be a minor manual component in physically handling records or typing the reports, the core of the task lies in the cognitive aspects of data analysis and report preparation. The manual elements are minimal and secondary to the primary cognitive nature of the work.
