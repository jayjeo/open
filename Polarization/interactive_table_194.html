However, there are also significant manual components to this task. Setting up and operating the machines requires physical interaction, hand-eye coordination, and dexterity. Workers must manipulate various parts of the machines, load materials, and physically control the equipment during operation.

It involves understanding complex regulatory issues, analyzing information, making decisions, and problem-solving, all of which are cognitive processes. The task requires knowledge of agriculture, biotechnology, and regulation, which involve learning and memory. There's no mention of any manual work like physical labor or the use of tools, so it doesn't contain any elements of a manual task. Therefore, this task is fully cognitive.", "reasoning_cognitive_OPUS": "Explanation: Specializing in regulatory issues related to agriculture, such as the cultivation of green biotechnology crops or the post-market regulation of genetically altered crops, is a highly cognitive task. It requires extensive knowledge and understanding of agricultural practices, biotechnology, and relevant regulations. The task involves analyzing complex information, interpreting laws and guidelines, and making informed decisions based on this knowledge. It necessitates critical thinking, problem-solving, and the ability to navigate intricate legal and scientific landscapes.\n\nWhile there may be some manual components involved, such as reviewing physical documents or conducting field inspections, the core of the task lies in the mental processes of understanding, analyzing, and applying regulatory frameworks to"}];
