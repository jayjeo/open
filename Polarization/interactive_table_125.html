However, the task also involves a significant non-routine component. The director must make on-the-spot decisions based on the unique circumstances of each workday, such as worker availability, equipment conditions, and safety considerations.

            <td>Explanation: Directing workers on cutting teams involves a blend of cognitive and manual elements, but leans more towards the cognitive side. The task requires mental processes such as decision making, communication, and coordination to effectively guide and manage the team's activities. The supervisor must assess the situation, determine the best course of action, and convey instructions clearly to the workers.

However, there is also a manual component to the task, as the supervisor may need to demonstrate techniques, handle tools or materials, or physically assist the team when necessary. The manual aspect is less prominent than the cognitive one, as the primary focus is on directing and overseeing the work rather than performing it directly.

The cognitive aspects include understanding the production process, analyzing the optimal speeds for each section, and making decisions to ensure smooth coordination between the machine parts. This requires mental skills such as problem-solving, reasoning, and decision-making.

However, the task also involves manual components. Adjusting the machine speeds may require physical interaction with the equipment, such as turning dials, pressing buttons, or using tools. The operator needs to use their hands and sensory-motor coordination to make the necessary adjustments accurately.

The task involves predictable, repetitive actions that do not require significant human judgment or creativity. Directing other workers to position items is a slightly less routine aspect, as it may involve some human communication and coordination. However, even this could potentially be handled through automated systems or simple, predefined instructions.

This is because it involves a set of predictable steps that are based on predetermined specifications. The task primarily involves information processing and repetitive actions, such as the selection of ingredients and the operation of mechanical mixers. While there is some level of human discretion involved in the selection of ingredients, this is likely to be based on a set recipe or formula, reducing the need for unpredictable judgment. Current technology, particularly in the fields of industrial automation and robotics, is likely capable of performing this task with minimal human oversight.

            <td>Explanation: The task of selecting and mixing ingredients to prepare coating substances according to specifications involves a combination of manual and cognitive elements, with a slight inclination towards manual characteristics.

Manual aspects:
1. The task requires physical manipulation of ingredients using tools such as paddles or mechanical mixers.
2. Sensory-motor coordination and dexterity are needed to handle the ingredients and operate the mixing equipment.

Cognitive aspects:
1. The task involves following specifications, which requires understanding and interpreting instructions.
