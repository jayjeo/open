            <td>Explanation: Representing clients before taxing authorities and providing support during litigation involving financial issues is primarily a cognitive task. It requires mental processes such as reasoning, problem-solving, decision making, and information processing. The task involves analyzing financial data, interpreting tax laws and regulations, and developing strategies to support clients during litigation. These activities heavily rely on cognitive skills and abilities.

However, there might be a minor manual component involved, such as preparing and handling physical documents or using a computer to access and manipulate data. Nevertheless, the core of the task is cognitive, as it requires the application of knowledge, critical thinking, and communication skills to effectively represent clients and provide support in financial matters.

            <td>Explanation: Creating and maintaining a database of completed appraisals is primarily a cognitive task. It involves mental processes such as organizing, categorizing, and managing information within a structured system. The task requires understanding the relationships between data elements, designing an efficient database structure, and ensuring data integrity and consistency.

However, there is a minor manual component to this task, which involves the physical input of data into the database system. This could include typing, clicking, and navigating through the database interface using input devices like a keyboard and mouse. The manual aspect is relatively small compared to the overall cognitive nature of the task.

It involves perception, attention to detail, and decision-making skills to identify and correct any errors in the information. The task requires mental processes to compare the provided information with the expected standard and make judgments about its accuracy.\n\nHowever, there is a minor manual component to this task, as it may involve some physical interaction with documents or a computer system to input corrections. The manual aspect is likely limited to basic data entry or navigation, which slightly shifts the score away from a purely cognitive classification.\n\nConsidering the strong emphasis on mental processes and the relatively minor manual component, a score of 0.7 is"}];
