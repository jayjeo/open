The actual process of extruding the curbing material is likely highly automated and predictable, following a set pattern or programming, which leans towards a routine task. However, driving the machine and ensuring it operates correctly in various environments may require some level of human judgment and adaptability to navigate job sites, adjust for conditions, or troubleshoot issues that arise. This introduces a non-routine component.

1. Inventory management systems can keep track of parts and supplies, alerting when stock is low or needs reordering.
2. Predictive maintenance software can schedule and track maintenance tasks for vehicles and equipment based on usage, time, or other predefined metrics.

On one hand, certain aspects of this task, such as organizing parts and supplies, can be automated and are thus routine. Inventory management systems and automated sorting machines can handle these tasks with little to no human intervention. 

On the other hand, maintaining tools, vehicles, and equipment often requires a level of human discretion and judgment to diagnose and resolve issues, which can be unpredictable. For instance, an individual might need to troubleshoot a mechanical problem in a vehicle or decide when a tool is too worn and needs to be replaced.
