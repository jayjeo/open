Manual aspects:
1. The physical act of conducting pat-down searches requires the use of hands and sensory-motor coordination to thoroughly check passengers for prohibited items.
2. Operating a hand-held wand to scan passengers also involves manual dexterity and precise movements to ensure proper coverage.

Cognitive aspects:
1. The task requires attention and perception to identify passengers who have triggered machine alarms, are unable to pass through metal detectors, or have been randomly selected for searches.

Monitoring energy market or regulatory conditions involves understanding complex and often unpredictable market dynamics. Identifying buying or other business opportunities within this context is not a straightforward process and cannot be fully automated. This is because it requires a deep understanding of the market, the ability to interpret and analyze data, and the strategic thinking to identify opportunities. While machines can aid in the process by providing data and trend analysis, the final decision-making and strategic planning requires human input.
