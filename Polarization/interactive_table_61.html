However, there may be instances where human judgment is needed to make decisions, such as choosing between different editions or considering the quality and relevance of the content.

The actual acquisition of the textbooks can also be highly automated through online ordering systems or inventory management software.

For instance, once a list of required materials and supplies is created, the process of ordering and shipping these items can be automated through computer systems. This aspect of the task is predictable and repetitive, which leans towards the routine side.

However, the selection process might require some level of human discretion and judgment, especially when it comes to textbooks.

However, the task also requires a manual component, which is the physical act of obtaining the materials and supplies. This could involve going to a store or a library, physically picking up the textbooks, and possibly carrying them to a specific location.
