Quality control systems using sensors, cameras, and software can measure and verify material dimensions against specified tolerances. Assigning identification numbers to materials is a straightforward data entry task that can be handled by databases and inventory management systems.

However, there may be occasional exceptions or edge cases where human judgment is needed, such as evaluating materials with unusual shapes or dealing with discrepancies in the automated system's output. These situations could require a human to make a decision or troubleshoot the issue.
