While there might be some manual aspects involved, such as typing on a keyboard to input data or commands, these are minor in comparison to the cognitive demands of the task. Therefore, this task is classified as an extremely cognitive task.", "reasoning_cognitive_OPUS": "Explanation: Conducting statistical analyses to quantify risk is a highly cognitive task. It involves using mental processes, skills, and abilities to analyze data, interpret results, and draw conclusions. This task requires understanding statistical concepts, selecting appropriate analysis methods, and applying mathematical and computational techniques. Using statistical software or econometric models is a tool that facilitates the cognitive work, but the core of the task lies in the mental processes of data analysis, interpretation, and risk quantification. While there may be some minor manual elements in operating the software or inputting data, the overwhelming majority of this task is cognitive in nature, involving higher-order thinking skills.
