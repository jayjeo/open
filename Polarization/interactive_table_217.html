However, the key aspect of this task is using the experimental results to make recommendations, which demands human expertise, judgment, and problem-solving skills.\n\nFormulating recommendations for process formulas, instrumentation, or equipment specifications necessitates a deep understanding of the underlying scientific principles, the specific application context, and the implications of the experimental findings", "reasoningGPT": "This task involves a high degree of human discretion and expertise, leaning it towards being a non-routine task. The process of recommending formulas, instrumentation, or equipment specifications based on experimental results requires a deep understanding of the subject matter, the ability to interpret data, and the capacity to make informed decisions based on that data. While some elements of the task could potentially be automated, such as collecting and initially processing experimental data, the interpretation and recommendation aspect of the task is highly reliant on human judgment and intuition. It involves unpredictable problem-solving and decision-making that current automation technologies would struggle to replicate. However, due to the potential for some level of automation in the data collection and processing stages, this task does not fall into", "cognitivescore": 0.75, "cognitivescoreGPT": 0.7, "cognitivescoreOPUS": 0.8, "reasoning_cognitive_GPT": "This task appears to be more cognitive than manual. It involves the use of mental processes such as reasoning, decision making, and information processing. The task requires a person to analyze results from experiments and use that analysis to make recommendations on process formulas, instrumentation, or equipment specifications. While there may be some manual aspects involved in conducting the bench or pilot experimentation, the primary task of making recommendations based on the results of those experiments is largely cognitive. Therefore, a score of 0.7 is given, indicating a moderately cognitive task with some possible manual elements.", "reasoning_cognitive_OPUS": "Explanation: Recommending process formulas, instrumentation, or equipment specifications based on experimental results is a highly cognitive task. It requires the mental processes of analyzing and interpreting data from bench or pilot experiments, and then using that information to make informed decisions and recommendations. This task involves critical thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving skills to determine the most appropriate formulas, instrumentation, or equipment specifications based on the experimental findings.
