Public transportation systems, such as buses and trains, often use pre-recorded announcements or digital displays to inform passengers of upcoming stops and routes. This task requires minimal human discretion or unpredictable judgment, as the information is predetermined and can be delivered consistently through automated systems.

While there may be rare instances where a human announcement is necessary due to unforeseen circumstances or system malfunctions, these situations are exceptions rather than the norm. The vast majority of route and stop announcements can be handled by automated systems without the need for human intervention.

With advancements in technology, this task can be automated and is commonly performed by automated systems in many public transportation systems, such as trains and buses. However, there is a small degree of human discretion involved, particularly in situations where unexpected changes or announcements need to be made.
