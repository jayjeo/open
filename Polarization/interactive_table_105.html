The key aspects that make this task lean towards being routine are:

1. The task involves following a set of specifications, which implies that the process is predictable and well-defined. This suggests that the task can be standardized and potentially automated.

While the process of measuring voltage is straightforward and can be performed by following a set of predefined steps, it still requires some level of human involvement and judgment.

Voltage meters are tools that provide a digital or analog reading of the voltage in an electrical system.

However, there is a minor cognitive component to the task. The worker must select the appropriate cloth and solvent for the specific type of lens or eyeglass material to avoid damaging the surface. This selection process involves a basic level of decision-making and knowledge application.

Despite this cognitive element, the vast majority of the task is</td>

The key aspects that make this task lean towards being routine are:\n\n1. The task involves following a set of specifications, which implies that the process is predictable and well-defined. This suggests that the task can be standardized and potentially automated.\n\n2. The use of hand tools indicates that the task is largely manual and repetitive.
