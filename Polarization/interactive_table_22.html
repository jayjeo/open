This is especially true if the emergency work involves technical or specialized skills. However, it also likely involves physical activity, such as using tools or manipulating objects, which are characteristics of a manual task. The exact balance between cognitive and manual elements could vary depending on the exact nature of the emergency work, but given the information provided, it seems reasonable to score it slightly towards the cognitive side, hence the score of 0.6.</td>

            <td>Explanation: Monitoring and authorizing entrance and departure of individuals involves a blend of both manual and cognitive elements. 

The manual aspects include the physical presence required to observe and interact with people entering and leaving the premises. There may be some physical tasks involved, such as checking identification, operating security systems, or physically preventing unauthorized access.

However, the cognitive aspects are more significant. The task requires attentiveness and vigilance to monitor the flow of people. It involves perception and recognition to identify individuals and assess their authorization status. Decision-making skills are needed to determine whether to grant or deny access based on security protocols. The role also requires memory to recognize employees and frequent visitors.

They may also need to handle exceptions, such as when a storage area is full or an item is damaged. Therefore, while this task is primarily routine, there is a small degree of non-routine work involved, which</td>
