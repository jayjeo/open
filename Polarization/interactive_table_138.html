            <td>Explanation: Removing worn or damaged plastic block refractory linings of furnaces using hand tools is primarily a manual task. It involves physical effort, dexterity, and the manipulation of tools to complete the task. The main activities are the physical removal and handling of the linings, which requires manual skills and labor.

However, there is a minor cognitive component involved in assessing the condition of the linings to determine which ones need to be removed. This requires some level of perception, judgment, and decision-making. The worker needs to visually inspect the linings, identify signs of wear or damage, and decide which ones to remove based on their condition.
