These cognitive skills are used to determine which items are in short supply, to decide what needs to be ordered, and to identify patterns in usage that can inform future inventory decisions. However, the task also involves some manual elements, such as physically counting items and possibly moving them around. This blend of cognitive and manual elements makes this task moderately cognitive, hence the score of 0.7.</td>
            
            <td>Explanation: Inventory management involves a combination of manual and cognitive elements. The physical aspect of counting and verifying stock levels is a manual task that requires sensory-motor coordination and physical effort. However, the process also involves cognitive components such as attention to detail, memory, and decision-making skills to determine if the stock levels are adequate based on established criteria or historical data. The task requires the individual to process information about the current stock, compare it to the desired levels, and make judgments about the sufficiency of the inventory.

Given the blend of manual and cognitive elements, where the cognitive aspects slightly outweigh the manual components, a score of 0.6 is assigned. This</td>
