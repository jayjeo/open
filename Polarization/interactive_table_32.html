These actions require sensory-motor coordination, dexterity, and physical effort.

However, driving also involves significant cognitive elements. Drivers must constantly perceive and process information from their surroundings, including road conditions, traffic signs, and the behavior of other vehicles and pedestrians. They need to make quick decisions, such as when to change lanes, turn, or stop, based on this information. Drivers also need to navigate, plan routes, and communicate with</td>

The task requires dexterity and precision to properly align and fasten the attachments.

However, there is a minor cognitive component involved in the task. The operator needs to have knowledge of the proper attachment points and the correct way to secure the connections. They must also ensure that the attachments are compatible with the specific tractor or tow truck. This requires a basic level of understanding and decision-making.

These activities heavily rely on cognitive skills like critical thinking, problem-solving, and strategic planning.

While there might be some minor manual elements involved, such as inputting data into a spreadsheet or writing down notes, these are secondary to the core cognitive aspects of the task. The majority of the work in budget development revolves around mental processes, making it lean strongly towards the cognitive end of the spectrum.
