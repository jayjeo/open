It involves physical manipulation of objects (books, containers, labels, straps) and requires manual dexterity, precision, and sensory-motor coordination to complete the task effectively.

The main components of the task, such as placing books in containers, applying labels, and securing the containers, are all manual activities that do not require significant cognitive processing. While there may be a minor cognitive element in reading the address labels to ensure they are correctly placed, this is a relatively small part of the overall task.

The physical handling of money, checks, or money orders, as well as the act of sending these items for further processing, are manual tasks. However, the process of accurately recording transactions requires cognitive skills such as attention to detail, basic mathematical calculations, and the ability to follow established procedures.

The task leans slightly more towards the manual side due to the physical handling of payment methods and the sending of items. Nevertheless, the cognitive aspects of recording transactions and ensuring accuracy prevent it from being classified as an extremely manual task.

1. Reviewing and evaluating the applicant's qualifications, interview performance, and overall fit for the position. This requires cognitive skills such as information processing, comparison, and judgment.

2. Deciding whether to accept or reject the applicant based on predefined criteria and the evaluation process. This decision-making aspect is a key cognitive component.
