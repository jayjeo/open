However, the task also involves non-routine components that require human judgment and decision-making. For example, determining the priority and urgency of hearings, considering the availability and suitability of participants, and resolving scheduling conflicts may require human intervention and discretion. Additionally, some hearings may involve unique or complex circumstances that necessitate custom scheduling arrangements, which falls into the non-routine category.

However, it does require some level of human discretion and judgment, particularly in unpredictable situations that may arise during the arrest process. For example, the person to be arrested might resist or there could be unexpected circumstances that require on-the-spot decision making. Therefore, while this task is largely routine, it is not fully automatable with current technology due to the need for human oversight and unpredictable judgment.

- The process of packing pottery can be standardized to some extent, with specific guidelines for wrapping, cushioning, and boxing the items to minimize damage during shipping.
- Shipping procedures, such as labeling packages, generating shipping documents, and coordinating with shipping carriers, can be largely automated or follow a predictable workflow.

Non-routine aspects:
- Each piece of pottery may have unique characteristics (shape, size, fragility) that require some level of human judgment and adaptation when packing</td>
            
            <td>The task of packing and shipping pottery to stores or galleries for retail sale is primarily routine, as it involves a series of repetitive actions that could be automated. This includes the steps of packing the pottery safely, labeling the packages, and arranging for their shipment. However, the task is not entirely routine due to the fragile nature of pottery. Human judgement is needed to ensure that each piece is packed securely enough to prevent damage during transit. This requires a level of discretion and problem-solving that is not easily automated. Therefore, while this task is largely routine, the need for human oversight to ensure the safe packing of fragile items makes it moderately routine.</td>
