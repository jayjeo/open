            <td>Explanation: Serving on academic or administrative committees primarily involves cognitive tasks. Committee members engage in various mental processes such as perception, thinking, reasoning, decision making, and information processing to deal with institutional policies, departmental matters, and academic issues. These activities require analyzing information, discussing ideas, evaluating options, and making decisions based on the available data and the committee's objectives.

While some manual tasks may be involved, such as handling documents or taking notes, these are minimal and secondary to the main cognitive aspects of the role. The core responsibilities of committee members revolve around intellectual contributions, problem-solving, and policy-making, all of which are cognitive in nature.

It involves mental processes such as communication, problem-solving, and providing guidance to students based on their individual needs and questions. The advisor must listen to the students, understand their concerns, and provide appropriate advice or assistance. This requires cognitive skills like active listening, critical thinking, and decision-making.\n\nWhile there might be some minor manual components involved, such as arranging materials or typing notes during the advising sessions, these are not the central aspects of the task.
