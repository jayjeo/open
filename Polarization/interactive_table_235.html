            <td>Explanation: Installing or repairing air purification systems involves a combination of manual and cognitive tasks. The manual aspects include the physical manipulation of tools and equipment to install, replace, or repair components such as filters or UV light systems. This requires manual dexterity, precision, and physical effort.

However, the task also involves cognitive elements. Technicians need to understand the functioning of the air purification systems, diagnose issues, and determine the appropriate course of action for installation or repair. This requires knowledge of the systems, problem-solving skills, and decision-making abilities.

This cognitive component, while not as prominent as the manual component, does play a significant role in the successful completion of the task and thus justifies a score slightly closer to the middle of the range.</td>
            
            <td>Explanation: This task involves a blend of manual and cognitive elements. The physical manipulation of micrometers, calipers, and precision measuring instruments to check grooves, angles, or gap allowances is a manual component. It requires sensory-motor coordination, dexterity, and the physical handling of tools.

However, there is also a significant cognitive aspect to this task. Interpreting the measurements from these instruments and comparing them to specified tolerances or standards involves mental processes such as perception, reasoning, and decision making. The worker must understand how to read and interpret the measurements correctly, which requires cognitive skills.
