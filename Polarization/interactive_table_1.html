Determining what constitutes surplus or unclaimed property, deciding the best method of disposal, and ensuring that disposal is carried out in accordance with relevant laws and regulations, are all aspects that require human discretion. Therefore, while this task has routine elements, it also has non-routine characteristics that prevent it from being fully automatable.</td>

The cognitive aspects include decision-making processes related to determining what property is considered surplus or unclaimed, as well as planning and organizing the disposal process. This may require knowledge of relevant policies, procedures, and regulations. Additionally, overseeing the disposal process involves cognitive tasks such as monitoring, supervising, and ensuring compliance with established guidelines.

However, the actual disposal of property likely involves manual tasks, such as physically handling, moving, and disposing of items. This may require physical effort, dexterity, and the use of tools or equipment.
