It requires the use of mental processes such as understanding the question, recalling relevant information about benefits and procedures, reasoning to determine the appropriate response, and communicating the answer effectively. The task involves processing information, drawing upon knowledge and memory, and engaging in problem-solving to address the applicants' inquiries.

While there may be some manual elements involved, such as typing or speaking to deliver the response, these are secondary to the core cognitive aspects of the task. The primary focus is on the mental processes of comprehension, retrieval, reasoning, and communication.
