            <td>Explanation: Weighing or measuring materials and products using scales or other measuring instruments is primarily a manual task. It involves physical manipulation of tools (scales or measuring instruments) and sensory-motor coordination to read the measurements accurately. The task also requires some level of precision and dexterity to handle the materials and products being weighed or measured.

However, there is a minor cognitive component involved in interpreting the scales, understanding the specified tonnages, and preventing overloads. The worker needs to mentally process the information from the scales and make decisions based on that information to ensure the correct measurements and prevent issues.

However, it also involves cognitive aspects such as perception, attention, and decision-making to anticipate and counteract the load's swinging motion.

The manual component is evident in the physical effort and sensory-motor coordination required to guide the load. The person performing the task must use their hands and body to apply force and control the load's trajectory. This aspect of the task is similar to other manual tasks that involve manipulation of objects.

However, there is a minor cognitive component involved in understanding the proper alignment and placement of the receptacles relative to the spouts. The worker needs to assess the size, shape, and capacity of the bins, carts, or containers to ensure they are compatible with the loading process. They also need to consider the flow and trajectory of the material from the spouts to optimize the loading efficiency.

2. Analysis: Breaking down the information into relevant components and identifying key points to be included in the reports.

3. Synthesis: Combining the information in a coherent and meaningful manner to create comprehensive reports.

4. Communication: Presenting the information effectively through various formats, such as written reports, oral presentations, tables, and graphics.</td>
