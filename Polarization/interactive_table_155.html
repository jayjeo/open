Some aspects of this task, such as regular cleaning, inspections, or preventive maintenance, can be fairly predictable and potentially automated to a certain extent. For example, robotic cleaners could handle routine cleaning of fitness facilities, and computerized systems could track and schedule regular maintenance intervals for equipment.

However, there are also non-routine components that require human judgment and problem-solving skills.

On the manual side, the maintenance of fitness equipment can involve physical processes such as using tools, manipulating objects, and employing physical effort. This could involve tasks like tightening screws, replacing parts, or cleaning equipment. On the cognitive side, arranging for maintenance involves decision-making and possibly problem-solving. It requires the ability to assess the state of the equipment, decide whether it needs maintenance or replacement, and find the right person or service to do the job. Additionally, if the person is doing the maintenance themselves, they would need to use reasoning and problem-solving skills to figure out what's wrong with the equipment</td>

The actual maintenance work, such as repairing, cleaning, or servicing the equipment, is primarily a manual task that requires physical effort, dexterity, and the use of tools. However, the task also involves cognitive aspects, such as assessing the condition of the equipment, diagnosing issues, deciding on appropriate maintenance actions, and potentially coordinating with others for more complex maintenance needs. The arrangement component of the task, which may include scheduling, planning, and communication, leans more towards the cognitive domain.
