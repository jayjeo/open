It involves mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, reasoning, and decision making. The task requires the ability to gather and process information, ask relevant questions, listen actively, and make judgments based on the collected data. Observational techniques and assessment methods also rely heavily on cognitive skills to identify patterns, interpret behaviors, and draw conclusions.

However, there may be some minor manual elements involved, such as taking notes, recording observations, or using assessment tools. These manual components are likely secondary to the primary cognitive nature of the task.
